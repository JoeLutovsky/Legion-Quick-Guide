              <h4>Abilities</h4>
              <p>
                Cards contain abilities that either grant passive effects to
                units or can be triggered for specific effects.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Abilities on unit cards are presented as keywords. The front
                  of each unit card provides reminder text for that unit’s unit
                  keywords. The back of each unit card provides reminder text
                  for that unit’s weapon keywords.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Reminder text is not an exhaustive description of the
                      rules for a keyword. If a player has questions about how a
                      keyword works, that player should refer to that keyword’s
                      glossary entry.

                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Upgrade cards and command cards also contain abilities in the
                  form of keywords.
                </li>
                <li>

                  />) icon, that ability can be performed as a card action as
                  one of the two actions that a unit can perform during its
                  activation.
                </li>

                  />) icon, that ability can be performed as a free card action
                  in addition to the two actions that a unit can perform during
                  its activation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Some cards must be exhausted as a cost to perform the ability
                  on the card. Such a card contains an exhaust (<img
                    class="game-icon"

                    <li>
                      If a card that has an exhaust icon is already exhausted, a
                      player cannot resolve that card’s ability until the card
                      is readied.

                    <li>
                      A unit can ready any number of its exhausted cards by
                      performing a recover action.

                </li>
                <li>
                  If the timing of an ability uses the word “after,” that
                  ability’s effect occurs immediately after the described timing
                  event has occurred.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the timing of an ability uses the word “when,” that
                  ability’s effect occurs at the exact moment of the described
                  timing event.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the timing of an ability uses the word “while,” that
                  ability’s effect occurs during a specific step of the
                  described timing event.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If an ability allows a unit to trigger an effect after it
                  moves, the ability can be triggered after any type of move,
                  but not after the unit withdraws, unless that unit is a
                  creature or emplacement trooper.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If an effect provides a unit with either a move or an attack
                  that is not an action or free action, performing that move or
                  attack does not trigger abilities that occur after move or
                  attack actions are performed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If an effect allows a unit to gain an aim, dodge, or standby
                  token, that effect is different than performing an aim, dodge,
                  or standby action and does not trigger abilities that occur
                  after those actions are performed.

                      Each card action is a unique action; a unit can perform

                  game effects and therefore does not allow a unit to perform

                  If an effect provides a unit with a free action without
                  specifying a type of action, that unit may perform any action
                  that it could normally perform. Performing that free action
                  does not count against that unit’s two actions per activation,
                  but is considered an action for the purposes of game effects

                  During a unit’s activation, it is possible for it to perform
                  multiple attacks through the use of command cards or other
                  abilities. If an effect provides a unit with an attack during
                  its activation, and that attack is not an action or free
                  action, performing that attack does not count toward a unit’s
                  limit of a single attack action per activation. It is not an
                  action and therefore does not count against that unit’s two
                  actions per activation and does not trigger abilities that
                  occur after actions are performed.

                    This additional attack is not an attack action, and

                      A unit that is not suppressed can perform up to two

                        <li>
                          A droid trooper or vehicle unit also loses one action

                  chooses a friendly unit with a matching rank that does not

                  activated—usually because that unit was defeated and removed

                  When a unit performs an aim action, that unit gains an aim

                  Unit abilities and other effects can allow units to gain aim

                <li>
                  During a unit’s activation, it is possible for a unit to gain

                    <li>
                      Aim tokens are spent during the “Reroll Dice” substep of

                <li>
                  If a unit has multiple aim tokens, that unit can choose to

                <li>
                  A unit can reroll the same die multiple times by spending

              <h4>Attack</h4>
              <p>Units can perform attacks to attempt to defeat enemy units.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A unit typically performs an attack by performing an attack
                  action during its activation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  During a unit’s activation, it is possible for a unit to
                  perform more than one attack through the use of card abilities
                  or other game effects; however, that unit can only perform one
                  attack action during a single activation, regardless of
                  whether it is an attack action or a free attack action.
                </li>
                <li>
                  During an attack, the unit that is performing the attack is
                  the attacker and the target of the attack is the defender.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Multiple units can be chosen as defenders (see step 3).
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  There are two types of attacks: ranged and melee.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      During a ranged attack, the attacker and defender are not
                      in a melee, and the attacker can use only weapons that
                      have a blue range (<img

                      During a melee attack, the attacker and defender are in a
                      melee, and the attacker can use only weapons that have a
                      red melee (<img

                <li>
                  Command cards, unit abilities, and other game effects can
                  allow units to perform attacks. The card granting the attack
                  will specify whether the attack is an attack action, a free
                  attack action, or neither.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To perform an attack, a player resolves the following steps:
                </li>
              </ul>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Declare Defender:</strong>
                  The attacking player chooses one enemy unit to attack; this
                  enemy unit is now the defender. Then, the attacking player
                  measures the range from the attacker’s unit leader to the
                  closest miniature of the defender to determine the attack’s
                  range.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Form Attack Pool:</strong>
                  The attack pool consists of all the dice the attacker will
                  roll against this defender. When forming the attack pool,
                  players follow these substeps in order:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <em>Determine Eligible Minis:</em>
                      Each mini in the attacker is eligible to contribute to the
                      attack pool if that mini has line of sight to any mini in
                      the defender.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <em>Choose Weapons:</em> The attacker can choose one
                      weapon from each eligible mini to contribute to the attack
                      pool. To choose a weapon, the attacker must meet all
                      requirements indicated by that weapon’s keywords, and that
                      weapon’s range must include the range of the attack, as
                      determined from the attacker’s unit leader to the closest
                      mini of the defender.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <em>Gather Dice:</em> For each eligible mini that chose a
                      weapon, the attacker gathers the number and type of dice
                      depicted on that weapon and places them on the battlefield
                      near the defender.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Declare Additional Defender:</strong>
                  If there are any weapons remaining that have not been added to
                  the attack pool, the player may repeat steps 1–2, forming a
                  separate attack pool with the new weapons.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Each eligible mini can contribute a weapon to only one
                      attack pool, unless it has the
                      <strong class="keyword-reference">arsenal x</strong>
                      keyword and can use more than one weapon during an attack.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      An attack pool can consist of dice from different weapons,
                      but all weapons with an identical name must contribute
                      their dice to the same attack pool.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The dice in each attack pool should be placed near the
                      corresponding defender.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  <strong>Roll Attack Dice:</strong>
                  The attacker chooses an attack pool and resolves the following
                  substeps in order:

                      <em>Reroll Dice:</em> The attacker can resolve any
                      abilities that allow the attacker to reroll attack dice.

                      turning the die. If no result is indicated, the attacker
                      changes the result to a blank.

              <h4>Attack Pool</h4>
              <p>
                An attack pool is a number of dice generated from weapons that
                are being used against a single target during an attack.
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Each weapon that is used during an attack contributes one or
                  more dice to an attack pool.
                </li>
                <li>
                  During an attack, the attacker can create multiple attack
                  pools to attack multiple defenders. However, only one attack
                  pool can be assigned to each defender.
                </li>
                <li>
                  An attack pool can consist of dice from different weapons, but
                  all weapons with an identical name must contribute their dice
                  to the same attack pool.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A weapon can only contribute its dice to an attack pool if the
                  following restrictions are met:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      The range of the attack is equal to or greater than the
                      weapons’ minimum range and equal to or less than the
                      weapon’s maximum range.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The miniature using the weapon has line of sight to at
                      least one mini in the defending unit.
                    </li>
                    <li>If the weapon can exhaust, it must be readied.</li>
                    <li>
                      To add a weapon with the
                      <strong class="keyword-reference">fixed: x</strong>
                      keyword to the attack pool, the defender must be inside
                      the specified firing arc of the attacking mini.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Each weapon that contributes dice to an attack pool also
                  applies its keywords to that attack pool.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      If a weapon has a keyword that allows a player to modify
                      one or more dice in the attack pool, the player can use
                      that effect to modify any dice in the attack pool, not
                      just the dice that this weapon contributed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If a weapon has a keyword that changes how the results of
                      the attack roll affects the defender, the entire attack
                      roll affects the defender in that way, not just dice that
                      the weapon that has that keyword contributed.<br /><br />
                      <em
                        >For example, if a weapon that has the blast keyword
                        contributed dice to an attack pool, the results from all
                        the dice in that attack pool ignore the defender’s
                        cover.</em

                  The orientation of a mini affixed to a small round base has no
                  gameplay implications. A player can freely rotate a mini
                  affixed to such a base during its movement.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A mini affixed to a notched base cannot be rotated freely;
                  during its movement, it must either pivot or move along the
                  movement tool, keeping the notches in the base aligned with
                  the movement tool.

                <li>
                  The space created by the notch in a mini's base should be
                  treated as a part of that mini's base by other minis.
                  Therefore, no mini’s base may be placed inside the notches of
                  another mini’s base.

              <h4>Base Contact</h4>
              <p>
                Base contact refers to a miniature’s base physically touching
                something on the battlefield, typically a piece of terrain,
                another mini, or an objective token.
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  If the bases of two minis are touching each other, those minis
                  are in base contact.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If a mini’s base is touching a piece of terrain or an
                  objective token, that mini is in base contact with that
                  terrain or token.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Friendly minis from different units can be in base contact
                  with each other.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Minis cannot be in base contact with minis from enemy units,
                  unless the unit leader has a melee weapon (<img
                    class="game-icon"
                    src="img/legion-melee.png"
                    alt="Melee Symbol"
                  />), in which case the unit leader can perform a move into
                  base contact with a mini from an enemy unit to start a melee.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Because a mini’s base can overhang a ledge or be placed askew
                  on top of uneven terrain, there are sometimes situations in
                  which an another mini cannot be placed into physical base
                  contact with the first mini because of a slight difference in
                  elevation between the two bases. In these situations, if two
                  conditions are met, those minis are treated as if they are in
                  base contact. These conditions are as follows:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      First, when viewed from above, there is no space between
                      the two minis bases, such that if they were not on
                      differing elevations or they were both flat on the
                      battlefield, their bases would be touching.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Second, the vertical space separating the two bases is
                      less than the thickness of a standard
                      <em>STAR WARS: LEGION</em> base.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If these two conditions are met, minis in this situation
                      are considered to be in base contact and follow all the
                      normal rules for being in base contact.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  If a player is attempting to move a mini into base contact
                  with another mini and those minis are blocked from being
                  placed in base contact by the non-base portion of either mini,
                  the payer that is moving the mini may alter that mini’s final
                  position, within an acceptable margin, such that the minis are
                  placed in base contact.
                  <!--For further rules, see
                  "Margin of Error" on page 11-->
                </li>
                <li>
                  Units cannot be placed into or move into base contact with an
                  enemy mini during Setup.

                The Payload objective card requires two bomb cart miniatures. A
                bomb cart mini consists of a repulsor pallet miniature affixed
                to a 50mm notched base with 1 to 2 bombs, or similarly sized
                minis, placed on top of the pallet. When playing a game with the
                Payload objective card, each player may supply their own bomb
                cart. Or, if one player has supplied both bomb carts, the other
                player should choose which of the two bomb carts is theirs to
                use for that game.

              <p>
                Each piece of terrain chosen while resolving the Payload
                objective card must be touching the battlefield directly.

                <li>
                  A bomb cart mini provides heavy cover to non-creature

                  mini’s base.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A bomb cart mini can move through all units, friendly and
                  enemy, but cannot end its movement overlapping the base of
                  another mini that cannot be displaced.

                    <li>
                      A bomb cart mini can move through a group of friendly and
                      enemy minis engaged in a melee, but cannot displace them.

                  A bomb cart mini’s final position can overlap a trooper mini’s
                  base if that trooper mini can be displaced. Doing so displaces

                <li>
                  A bomb cart mini ignores the effects of difficult terrain.

                  A bomb cart mini can move through or over impassible terrain,

              <h4>Card Actions</h4>
              <p>
                A card action is a type of action. If an ability is preceded by
                a card action (<img
                  src="img/legion-action.png"
                  class="game-icon"
                />) icon, that ability is a card action.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Each card action is a unique action; a unit can perform
                  different card actions during its activation. However, a unit
                  cannot perform the same card action more than once during its
                  activation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If a card action provides a unit with either a move or an
                  attack that is <strong>not</strong> treated as a move action
                  or an attack action, performing that move or attack is
                  different than performing a move action or attack action, even
                  though the result is the same.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Some card actions are treated as other types of actions, such
                  as a move action or an attack action. This is indicated in the
                  text of the card action itself. When a unit performs that card
                  action, treat that action as the type of action indicated in
                  its text, as well as a card action, for the purposes of all
                  gameplay effects and abilities, including triggering other
                  abilities that occur after the indicated action.<br /><br />
                  <em>
                    For example, after performing a move, if Darth Vader is
                    equipped with the Saber Throw upgrade card, he can use the
                    relentless ability to perform a ranged attack using the
                    Saber Throw card action.</em

                </li>
                <li>
                  Card actions can allow units to gain aim, dodge, and standby
                  tokens. If a card action specifically instructs a unit to gain
                  an aim, dodge, or standby token, that effect is different than
                  performing an aim, dodge, or standby action and therefore does
                  not trigger abilities that occur after aim, dodge, or standby
                  actions are performed.

                Climbing and clambering are types of movement that allow a unit
                to move vertically onto or over a piece of elevated terrain.
                While clambering, a unit might suffer damage.

                      leader on at the end of this movement and the unit can
                      maintain cohesion, a unit can spend two actions to safely
                      move vertically up or down a distance up to height 1. At
                      the end of this move, the unit leader is placed on the
                      flat surface at the top or bottom of the vertical

                      To clamber over a vertical piece of terrain without a flat
                      surface on top, a unit can spend
                      <strong>two</strong> actions to move over the terrain. At
                      the end of this move, the unit leader is placed on a flat

                <li>
                  After the unit leader climbs or clambers, each other mini is
                  placed in cohesion with that leader as normal.

                    <li>
                      Minis in the same unit can be placed on different vertical

                      leader.

                  When measuring cohesion between two minis that are placed on
                  different vertical levels, a player should measure from the
                  unit leader to each mini using the speed-1 movement template,
                  measuring from a view above the battlefield as if the two
                  minis are on the same vertical level.

                      When separated by vertical distances, the position of a

                      within the distance of a legal climb move. If a unit
                      leader is on top of elevated terrain, any minis in that
                      unit that are below their unit leader must be in base
                      contact with that terrain such that moving between the
                      position of the leader and the position of any mini in the
                      unit is a legal climb move.

                        <li>
                          For the distance between a mini’s position and its
                          unit leader’s position to be a legal climb move, it
                          must be height 1 or lower.

                      After climbing or clambering, the unit leader will by
                      default be on the edge of the terrain closest to the point
                      with which it was in base contact before climbing or
                      clambering. Minis not placed on the same edge of the
                      terrain as the leader must be placed in base contact with
                      the terrain and as close as possible to this point.

                      clambered, or lower than the level to which the unit
                      leader climbed or clambered if the unit leader moved
                      downwards.

                      unit leader, unless that mini’s unit leader has just
                      climbed or clambered. Minis can always be placed onto the
                      same level as their unit leader when being placed in
                      cohesion.

                  A unit does not have to climb or clamber to move up a gradual
                  slope such as a hill. As a general rule, if a miniature can be
                  placed on a slope without falling over, units can move up that
                  slope by performing a standard move. Players should clearly

                  When a unit climbs or clambers, the bases of the minis in the

                  stable and is not precariously placed. If there is not room to
                  place a unit leader’s base on the surface that the unit is
                  climbing or clambering onto, or if any mini’s base cannot be
                  placed legally and maintain cohesion, that unit cannot perform
                  that climb or clamber action.

              <h4>Cohesion</h4>
              <p>
                Each non-leader miniature in a unit must be in cohesion with its
                unit leader.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  After a unit leader moves, is deployed to the battlefield, or
                  is displaced on the battlefield, each other mini in that unit
                  must be placed in cohesion with that unit leader.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A mini is in cohesion with its unit leader if the distance
                  between a mini and its unit leader is equal to or less than
                  the length of the speed-1 movement tool.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      If the base of a unit leader is touching one end of the
                      speed-1 movement tool, and the base of a different mini in
                      that unit is touching the other end of the speed-1
                      movement tool, those minis are at the maximum distance of
                      cohesion.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  When a notched base mini is placed in cohesion, its base must
                  be oriented in the exact same direction as the unit leader’s
                  base.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When placing a mini in cohesion, it cannot be placed in base
                  contact with enemy minis, unless the unit is in a

                </li>
                <li>
                  When moving a unit leader, a player can push aside any minis
                  from that unit to make it easier to place the movement tool on
                  the battlefield.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If moving multiple units at the same time because of
                  displacement, a player can move the unit leaders from those
                  units first, and then place the remaining minis in cohesion
                  with their respective leaders.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When placing minis in cohesion, the bases of the minis in the
                  unit can partially overhang ledges, as long as the mini is
                  stable and is not precariously placed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When placing a mini in cohesion with its unit leader, that
                  mini must be placed such that the distance between the mini
                  and its unit leader could be made as a legal speed-1 move from
                  the final position of the unit leader.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      This means that when placing a mini in cohesion with its
                      unit leader it cannot be placed on the other side of
                      impassable terrain from its unit leader.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      However, minis being placed in cohesion are considered to
                      be able to move through any enemy trooper minis with which
                      they are engaged.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Notched-based minis must obey this rule; however, the
                      speed-1 move between the mini’s position and the unit
                      leader’s position is determined as if both the mini and
                      the unit leader can pivot up to 180&#176; before and after
                      the move is measured.<br /><br /><em
                        >For example, a mini is placed such that the distance
                        between it and its unit leader is equal to or less than
                        the length of the speed-1 movement tool; however, there
                        is a piece of blocking terrain between the mini and its
                        unit leader. If the mini is placed in such a way that
                        there is a legal speed-1 move around the piece of
                        blocking terrain between the position of the mini and
                        the position of the unit leader, then cohesion is
                        maintained, but if there is not a legal speed-1 move
                        between the position of the mini and the position of the
                        leader, then the mini is not in cohesion.</em

                </li>
                <li>
                  When separated by vertical distances, the position of a mini
                  from the position of its unit leader must also be a legal
                  climb move. If a unit leader is on top of elevated terrain,
                  any minis in that unit that are below their unit leader must
                  be in base contact with that terrain such that moving between
                  the position of the leader and the position of any mini in the
                  unit is a legal climb move.

                    <li>
                      In order for the distance between a mini’s position and
                      its unit leader’s position to be a legal climb move, it
                      must be height 1 or lower.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      After climbing or clambering, the unit leader will by
                      default be on the edge of the terrain closest to the point
                      with which it was in base contact before climbing or
                      clambering. Minis not placed on the same edge of the
                      terrain as the leader must be placed in base contact with
                      the terrain edge and as close as possible to this point.
                    </li>

                <li>
                  When placing a trooper mini in cohesion, it cannot be placed
                  higher than the level to which its unit leader climbed or
                  clambered (or lower than the level to which its unit leader
                  climbed or clambered if the unit leader moved downwards).
                </li>
                <li>
                  When placing a mini in cohesion, it cannot be placed onto a
                  <strong>different</strong> level of terrain than its unit
                  leader, unless that mini’s unit leader has just climbed or
                  clambered. Minis can always be placed onto the same level as
                  their unit leader when being placed in cohesion.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      If a unit performs a move that ignores terrain of a
                      certain height, such as via the hover:

                      <strong class="keyword-reference">speeder x</strong>
                      keywords, minis can be placed onto different levels of
                      terrain than their unit leader, as long as the vertical
                      distance between the levels is equal to or less than the
                      height of terrain that is ignored.

                  If a player’s character is defeated, any character-specific

                <li>
                  When playing an operative’s command card, the player does not
                  nominate a commander; instead they nominate the operative, and
                  that operative issues orders.

                  A player's command hand is not public knowledge, and its

                  A player’s discard pile is public knowledge, and an opponent
                  may ask to view a player's discard pile at any time.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      When a player returns a command card to their command hand
                      from their discard pile, they must tell their opponent
                      which card was returned.

                <li>
                  Some command cards allow specific units to gain keywords. The
                  specified unit has that keyword as long as the command card is

                  Some command cards contain weapon profiles. Typically there
                  are two ways these weapon profiles can be used: a unit
                  specified by the command card gains the weapon on the card and
                  can use it during its activation, or a unit specified by the
                  command card may perform an attack using the weapon on the
                  card at the end of its activation.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      If a unit gains a weapon from a command card, that weapon
                      is treated as though it is on the unit's unit card.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If a unit may perform an attack with a weapon on a command
                      card, it cannot use the
                      <strong class="keyword-reference">arsenal x</strong>
                      keyword to add additional weapons to the attack pool; the
                      attack must be made only with the weapon on the command
                      card. This does not apply to a weapon that a unit gains
                      via a command card, as that weapon is considered to be on
                      its unit card.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If a unit may perform an attack with a weapon on a command
                      card, it must be able to perform an attack of the type
                      specified by the range icon of the weapon. An engaged
                      trooper unit cannot perform ranged attacks, unless the
                      weapon has the
                      <strong class="keyword-reference">versatile</strong>
                      keyword.

                    <li>
                      If a unit gains a weapon from a command card, a
                      counterpart that is a part of that unit does not gain that
                      weapon, unless otherwise stated by a card effect.

              <h4>Command Phase</h4>
              <p>
                During the Command Phase, each player selects a command card
                from their hand and chooses a commander to issue orders to one
                or more units on the battlefield.<br /><br />
                To resolve the Command Phase, players perform the following
                steps in order:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Select Command Card:</strong>
                  Each player secretly selects a command card from their hand
                  and places it facedown on the table. Then, both players
                  simultaneously reveal their cards.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      If a player does not have a commander or an operative on
                      the battlefield, they do not select or resolve a command
                      card.
                    </li>
                    <li>A player must select a command card if able.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Determine Priority:</strong>
                  The player whose card has the fewest number of pips has
                  priority.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      If both cards have the same number of pips, the player who
                      has the round counter rolls a red defense die (six-sided
                      red die). If the result of the roll is a block (<img
                        src="img/legion-block.png"
                        alt="Block Symbol"
                        class="game-icon"
                      />), that player has priority. Otherwise, their opponent
                      has priority.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If one player plays a command card and their opponent does
                      not, the player who played a card has priority.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Issue Orders:</strong>
                  Starting with the player who has priority, each player
                  nominates a friendly eligible commander or operative and
                  issues orders with that unit. The number of orders to be
                  issued is indicated on the orders section of the chosen
                  command card.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      If a commander-specific or operative-specific command card
                      is played, the player must nominate that commander or
                      operative.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If a non-operative-specific command card is played, the
                      player cannot nominate an operative to issue orders.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      For a commander or operative to issue an order to a unit,
                      that unit must be eligible to receive that order. To be
                      eligible, a unit must meet all of the following
                      requirements:
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          The unit cannot have already received an order during
                          the current Command Phase.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          The unit must be at range 1–3 of the nominated
                          commander or operative.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          If a unit type (e.g., trooper) is specified on the
                          chosen command card, the unit being issued an order
                          must be of the specified type.
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Create Order Pool:</strong>
                  Each player creates an order pool that consists of all of
                  their order tokens that they did not place on the battlefield
                  while resolving their command card.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      It is recommended that players place their order tokens in
                      an opaque bag; however, players can also create their
                      order pool by placing each order token facedown near the
                      battlefield and then shuffling those tokens.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  After players resolve these four steps, play proceeds to the
                  Activation Phase.
                </li>

                      its previous rank. It is considered to be a commander for
                      all effects and game play purposes.

                      In the rare instance where a player no longer has a

                      and cannot play command cards.

                      A courage value of “–” is considered infinite when

              <h4>Compulsory Move</h4>
              <p>
                Some game effects require a unit to perform a compulsory move at
                the start or end of the Perform Actions step of its activation.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A compulsory move is a free standard move action.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      A compulsory move triggers abilities that occur after move
                      actions are performed. However, as a free action, it does
                      not count against the unit’s two actions per activation.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  While performing a compulsory move, if a unit's maximum speed
                  is reduced, that unit is still considered to be performing a
                  move at its maximum speed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To perform a compulsory move, the unit performs a full move at
                  its maximum speed. If it cannot do so, or if a full move would
                  cause any part of the unit leader’s base to be outside the
                  battlefield, it can perform a partial move instead, ending its
                  movement as far along the movement template as possible. If
                  the unit performs a partial movement in this way, the unit
                  suffers a number of wounds equal to its maximum speed.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      As the unit leader moves along a movement tool, if at any
                      point the unit leader's base is outside of the
                      battlefield, the unit is defeated.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  The final position of a compulsory move can displace trooper
                  units.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When a unit performs a compulsory move, the bases of the minis
                  in the unit can partially overhang ledges, as long as each
                  mini is stable and is not precariously placed. If there is not
                  room to place a unit leader’s base on the surface that the
                  unit is moving onto, or if any mini’s base cannot be placed
                  legally and maintain cohesion, that unit cannot complete the
                  compulsory move.
                </li>
                <li>
                  During a compulsory move, if the unit leader would end its
                  movement on a piece of terrain it would normally ignore due to
                  the
                  <strong class="keyword-reference">speeder x</strong> keyword
                  or the repulsor vehicle unit type, it may shift backwards
                  along the movement tool by a distance no greater than half the
                  length of its base, so that its base is able to be placed
                  legally on the battlefield or terrain piece. It may not do so
                  if the terrain is not ignored by the
                  <strong class="keyword-reference">speeder x</strong> keyword
                  or the repulsor vehicle unit type and would cause the unit to
                  be unable to complete the compulsory move.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      A unit leader’s base may only be moved backwards along the
                      movement tool, it cannot be moved forward past the end of
                      the movement tool.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      A unit leader’s base cannot be moved back more than half
                      the diameter of the base.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      A unit leader must still move as far along the movement
                      tool as possible, it may move back only to allow its base
                      to be placed legally and in a stable position on the
                      battlefield or piece of terrain.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If the unit leader still cannot be legally placed on the
                      battlefield, it moves as far along the movement tool as
                      possible and takes damage equal to its speed for failing
                      to complete its compulsory move.
                    </li>

                  If a unit has both the

              <h4>Contingencies X (Unit Keyword)</h4>
              <p>
                Some characters, both heroes and villains, think a couple steps
                ahead and have more than one plan to fall back on. While
                building a command hand, for each unit with the
                <strong class="keyword-reference">contingencies x</strong>
                keyword in a player’s army, that player sets aside up to x
                additional command cards as contingency cards, where x is equal
                to the combined
                <strong class="keyword-reference">contingencies x</strong> value
                on their units. These set-aside cards can have any number of
                pips but must follow all other command hand rules as if they
                were chosen for that player’s command hand.
              </p>
              <p>
                After a player reveals a command card, before any other effects
                are resolved, that player may discard it to reveal one of their
                setaside contingency cards instead. The revealed contingency
                card is then treated as a selected and revealed command card.
                The number of pips on the revealed contingency card
                <strong>must</strong> be equal to the number of pips on the
                discarded card.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Only command cards can be set aside as contingency cards.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Contingency cards are chosen and set aside while building an
                  army.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Contingency cards are <strong>not</strong> considered to be in
                  a player’s command hand.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When choosing contingency cards, a player cannot choose a card
                  with the same name as another of their contingency cards or a
                  card in their command hand.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When choosing contingency cards, a player cannot choose a card
                  with a unit name in the upper right that does not match the
                  name of a unit in their army.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Contingency cards are set-aside facedown. Like a player’s
                  command hand, they are considered to be hidden information. A
                  player can look at their own contingency cards at any time.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A contingency card can be reveled only if it could legally be
                  played as a command card. If a player reveals a contingency
                  card that cannot legally be played as a command card, it is
                  discarded and that player does not play a command card for
                  that round.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If both players have set-aside contingency cards, the blue
                  player must decide whether or not to reveal a contingency card
                  before the red player decides whether to reveal a contingency
                  card.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If all friendly units with contingencies x are defeated, a
                  player cannot reveal or use their contingency cards.
                </li>

                Some characters are faithful companions or subservient minions,
                and are almost never seen apart from another character. A
                character like this will have the
                <strong class="keyword-reference">counterpart</strong> keyword
                and the mini that represents that character is always added to
                another character’s unit. That character’s card is a counterpart
                card and their mini is a counterpart mini.
              </p>
              <p>
                A counterpart mini cannot be fielded as its own unit; it is
                instead added to another unit, specified by the
                <strong class="keyword-reference">counterpart</strong>
                keyword. A counterpart and its corresponding unit combine to
                form one unit, consisting of the counterpart and noncounterpart
                minis and represented by the combination of the unit card and
                the counterpart card.

                  value, surge conversion chart, and maximum speed shown on the
                  unit card.

                    <li>

                  suppression tokens and no longer being suppressed.

                  Immediately after the “Rally” step of a trooper unit’s
                  activation, if that unit has a number of suppression tokens
                  equal to or greater than twice its courage value, it panics.
                  During a panicked unit’s activation, it cannot perform free
                  actions and must use its entire activation to perform a single
                  move at its maximum speed as directly as possible toward the
                  nearest edge of the battlefield.

                    <li>
                      If the unit leader ends this movement with any part of its
                      base outside of the battlefield, the unit is defeated.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If a unit is at range 1–3 of a friendly commander, it may
                      use that commander’s courage value instead of its own when
                      checking to see if it is panicked.

                <li>
                  Some trooper units do not have a courage value. These units
                  have a “–” on their unit card where a courage value would
                  normally be.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      A trooper unit without a courage value cannot gain
                      suppression tokens. As such, that unit cannot become
                      suppressed or panicked.

              <h4>Cover</h4>
              <p>
                During a ranged attack, terrain that lies between two units can
                grant protection to the defender in the form of cover.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  There are two only types of cover: light cover and heavy
                  cover. Cover is usually granted by terrain.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Barricades provide heavy cover to non-creature trooper
                      units that they obscure.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Emplacement troopers provide light cover to units that
                      they obscure.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Creature troopers provide light cover to units that they
                      obscure.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Ground vehicles provide light or heavy cover to units that
                      they obscure. Walking or legged vehicles provide light
                      cover; wheeled or treaded vehicles provide heavy cover.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Minis in the same unit cannot obscure or provide cover to
                      one another.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Custom terrain can provide units with light or heavy
                      cover. Players should determine the cover type of all
                      custom terrain before the game begins.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  During the “Apply Dodge and Cover” step of a ranged attack, a
                  unit that has light cover can cancel one hit (<img

                  two hit (<img

                        alt="Crit Symbol"
                      />) results cannot be canceled by cover.
                    </li>

                </li>

                  Various game effects, such as suppression tokens and the
                  <strong class="keyword-reference">cover</strong> keyword, can
                  improve a unit’s cover by one or more.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      When a unit that does not have cover improves its cover by
                      one, it is treated as having light cover.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      When a unit that does not have cover improves its cover by
                      two or more, it is treated as having heavy cover.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      When a unit that has light cover improves its cover by one
                      or more, it is treated as having heavy cover.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If a unit has heavy cover, that unit does not gain any
                      benefit from improving its cover.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  To determine if a unit has cover during an attack, a player
                  performs the following steps:
                </li>
              </ul>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Determine Number of Obscured Miniatures:</strong>
                  The player checks line of sight from the attacker’s unit
                  leader to each mini in the defending unit. If any part of a
                  defending mini, including its base, is blocked by a piece of
                  terrain, the player then traces an imaginary line from the
                  center of the base of the attacker’s unit leader to the center
                  of the base of the defending mini. If the imaginary line
                  crosses the piece of terrain that blocked line of sight, the
                  defending mini is obscured. The player repeats this process
                  for each mini in the defender to determine how many of those
                  minis are obscured.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      If the attacking unit leader’s base is touching a piece of
                      terrain, that piece of terrain cannot cause a mini in the
                      defender to be obscured, unless line of sight from the
                      unit leader to that mini is completely blocked.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Ground vehicles, creature troopers, and emplacement
                      troopers can provide cover. When determining whether a
                      defending mini is obscured, treat any ground vehicle,
                      creature trooper, or emplacement trooper minis as if they
                      are pieces of area terrain.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If the attacking unit leader’s base is touching another
                      mini's base, that mini cannot cause a mini in the defender
                      to be obscured, unless line of sight from the unit leader
                      to the defending mini is completely blocked.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      When determining whether a piece of terrain blocks line of
                      sight to a defending mini with a notched base, if there is
                      a clear peg separating the defending mini and its base,
                      the clear peg and the base are not treated as a part of
                      the mini.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      When determining whether an imaginary line traced between
                      the centers of two minis' bases crosses a piece of
                      terrain, the line is always treated as horizontal to the
                      battlefield, on a two-dimensional plain. A player should
                      look down from above the battlefield to determine whether
                      the imaginary line crosses a piece of terrain.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Determine Cover:</strong> If at least half of all of
                  the defender’s minis are obscured, that unit has cover. The
                  type of cover that unit has is determined by the object that
                  is obscuring the minis, as follows:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      If the obscured minis are obscured by a ground vehicle,
                      that unit has either light or heavy cover, depending on
                      the vehicle.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If the obscured minis are obscured by a creature trooper
                      or emplacement trooper, that unit has light cover.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If the obscured minis are obscured by a barricade, and the
                      defender is a non-creature trooper unit, that unit has
                      heavy cover.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If the obscured minis are obscured by custom terrain, that
                      unit has the cover that the custom terrain provides.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      In the case that some of the obscured minis are obscured
                      by an object that provides light cover and some are
                      obscured by an object that provides heavy cover, that unit
                      has heavy cover, unless there are more minis that are
                      obscured by an object that provides light cover, in which
                      case the unit has light cover.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If an individual mini is obscured by both an object that
                      provides light cover and an object that provides heavy
                      cover, treat that mini as obscured by heavy cover.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      A defending unit on a piece of terrain with a higher
                      elevation than the attacking unit will usually have cover.
                      This is because when checking line of sight from the
                      attacking unit leader, a part of each defending minis'
                      base will most likely be obscured by the terrain that the
                      mini is on top of.

                A creature trooper is a type of unit. It is a subtype of the

                <li>
                  Creature trooper units follow the same rules as trooper units

                  When a vehicle unit is damaged, it gains a damaged token. The
                  token is placed on the battlefield near the unit leader and

                  When a player activates a damaged unit, before it performs any
                  actions, it rolls a white defense die. If the result is a
                  blank, that vehicle performs one fewer action during its

              <h4>Declaring Terrain</h4>
              <p>
                During setup, it is imperative to determine which effects each
                piece of terrain will have before the game begins. Players
                should briefly discuss each piece of terrain that will be on the
                battlefield and come to a consensus on its cover type and other
                characteristics.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Whether or not a piece of terrain will provide cover to a unit
                  usually depends on the size of that piece of terrain relative
                  to the minis in that unit. As a general rule, terrain that
                  blocks line of sight to half or more of a mini will provide
                  cover, while terrain that blocks less than half of a mini will
                  not. This means that trooper minis will frequently enjoy the
                  benefits of cover, while vehicles often will not.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Whether or not a piece of terrain will provide cover, and
                      if so to what units, should be determined
                      <strong>during</strong> setup.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Terrain either provides no cover, light cover, or heavy cover,
                  depending on its characteristics. Terrain that completely
                  blocks line of sight always provides heavy cover.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      The level of cover that a piece of terrain will provide,
                      and to what types of units, should be determined
                      <strong>during</strong> setup.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <!-- <li>Players should use the "Terrain Types" on page 8, as a
guide when determining terrain effects during setup. ADD THIS LATER</li> -->
                <li>
                  Once the level of cover that a piece of terrain will provide
                  has been determined during setup, that piece of terrain
                  provides that cover to the relevant units regardless of the
                  degree to which minis in those units are blocked by that
                  terrain.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Checking whether a piece of terrain is blocking half or
                      more, or less than half, of a mini is only used during
                      setup to determine whether or not that piece of terrain
                      will provide cover during the game.
                    </li>

                <li>
                  If a unit performs a move that causes any part of its unit

                  In the rare situation in which a unit leader is defeated and

                  become the unit leader—the player replaces the chosen mini

                      that player flips the objective token to its unclaimed

                      position and in base contact with the unit leader. The

              <h4>Defining the Battlefield</h4>
              <p>
                During setup, players define the battlefield by selecting
                objective, condition, and deployment cards. First, they shuffle
                the objective, deployment, and condition decks separately. Then,
                they draw and reveal three cards from each deck, placing the
                three cards from each deck in horizontal rows, called
                categories, facing the blue player’s long table edge. Then,
                starting with the blue player, each player takes turns choosing
                a category and eliminating the leftmost card in that category’s
                horizontal row until both players have had an opportunity to
                eliminate two cards. After each player has had two opportunities
                to eliminate a card, the leftmost card in each category’s row
                that was not eliminated is the card used to define the
                battlefield for the game.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A player may forfeit their opportunity to eliminate a card if
                  they wish to do so.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If players eliminate the first two cards in a category, the
                  final card cannot be eliminated.
                </li>

                When a token detonates, either through an ability or some other
                game effect, perform a separate attack against each unit
                (regardless of which player owns that unit) that the token has
                line of sight to, using the area weapon, surge conversion chart,
                and weapon keywords on the card associated with the token that
                is being detonated.
              </p>
              <p>
                After a token detonates, remove that token from the battlefield.

                    alt="Range 1 through 5 Symbols"
                  />) indicates that a weapon is an area weapon. When a charge
                  or condition token detonates, use the area weapon on the card
                  associated with that token.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When using an area weapon, perform a separate attack against
                  each unit that is in line of sight and at the range indicated
                  by the number on the range icon, determined from the edge of
                  the charge or condition token that is detonating.

                  For each attack made when a token detonates, that token is
                  considered the attacker.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When a token detonates, refer to the surge conversion chart
                  associated with that token, regardless of whether a unit
                  placed that token or used an ability to detonate it

                <li>
                  When a token detonates, units cannot spend aim tokens to
                  modify attack dice, regardless of whether a unit placed that
                  token or used an ability to detonate it.

                  When a token detonates, if there are multiple defending units,
                  the player who controls the unit that used an ability to
                  detonate the token chooses the order of the attacks made by
                  the charge token.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If a token would detonate after a unit performs a move or any
                  action, that token detonates before any other abilities or
                  effects that occur after a unit moves or performs an action;
                  with the exception of spending a standby token which can be
                  spent by a unit before the token detonates.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Ranged attacks made by area weapons are performed against each
                  unit at range and in line of sight, even if that unit is
                  engaged.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To determine line of sight from a token to a unit, determine
                  line of sight from the unit to the token instead. If any minis
                  in the unit have line of sight to the token, then the token
                  has line of sight to that unit and to those minis.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When a token detonates, if there are multiple defending units,
                  the player who controls the unit that caused the token to
                  detonate chooses the order of the attacks made by the
                  condition token.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Each attack made when a token detonates is a ranged attack.

              <h4>Difficult Terrain</h4>
              <p>
                Difficult terrain is anything that impedes but does not
                completely block movement.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  While performing a standard move, a unit that begins its move
                  with any of its minis in difficult terrain has its maximum
                  speed reduced by 1, to a minimum of 1.
                </li>
                <li>
                  While performing a standard move, a unit that would move
                  through or enter difficult terrain with any of its minis has
                  its maximum speed reduced by 1, to a minimum of 1.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      A unit that moves into base contact with difficult terrain
                      but does not move through it or enter it does not suffer
                      this speed reduction.<br /><br /><em
                        >For example, a unit of Stormtroopers whose unit leader
                        moves into base contact with a barricade does not reduce
                        its speed.</em
                      >
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  The effect of difficult terrain is not cumulative with itself.
                  A unit cannot reduce its maximum speed below 1 by moving
                  though multiple pieces of difficult terrain. However, the
                  effect of difficult terrain can be combined with other effects
                  that reduce a unit’s maximum speed to cause a unit’s maximum
                  speed to be less than 1.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When an effect causes a unit to perform a speed-x move, that
                  move is not affected by difficult terrain.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Difficult terrain affects vehicles, including when performing
                  a reverse, strafe, or compulsory move.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A unit can pivot, climb, or clamber while in difficult terrain
                  without suffering any additional penalties.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When a unit performs a move, apply any effects that increase
                  the unit’s maximum speed (up to speed 3), before applying any
                  effects that reduce that unit’s maximum speed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Whether or not a piece of terrain is difficult depends on a
                  unit’s type (trooper, ground vehicle, or repulsor vehicle).

                    >For example, a barricade is difficult terrain for trooper
                    units, but not for vehicle units. Both ground and repulsor
                    vehicle units can move through barricades without incurring
                    any penalties.</em

                      When using custom terrain, it is important to define the
                      difficulty of that terrain as it relates to each unit type
                      prior to the beginning of the game.

                A unit with the

                always specifically states the unit name, rank, or type of this
                other unit. Each Command Phase, during the Issue Orders step, a
                unit with the
                <strong class="keyword-reference">direct</strong> keyword may
                issue an order to a friendly unit at range 1–2 that meets the

                  Game effects that trigger when a unit is issued an order, such
                  as those on command cards, trigger when a unit is issued an

                When a ground vehicle or creature trooper moves through trooper
                miniatures, it displaces them.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  When a ground vehicle or creature trooper mini moves along the
                  path created by a movement tool, if its base would overlap any
                  trooper minis, those minis are displaced.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When a repulsor vehicle mini’s final position would overlap
                  one or more trooper minis during a
                  <strong>compulsory</strong> move, those minis are displaced.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Trooper units that are engaged cannot be displaced, and thus
                  cannot be moved through by ground vehicles or creature
                  troopers. Repulsor vehicles and other trooper units can move
                  through engaged troopers.

                    <li>
                      Creature and emplacement troopers cannot be displaced, and
                      thus cannot be moved through by ground vehicles and other
                      creature troopers.

                    <li>
                      While withdrawing, creature trooper minis

              </ul>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Set Aside Minis:</strong> Any displaced minis are
                  placed to the side of the battlefield without disrupting other
                  minis or objects on the battlefield. If a unit leader is
                  displaced, a player should mark its original position using a
                  spare token.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Move:</strong> The mini that displaced the trooper
                  minis continues its move as normal, unimpeded by the minis it
                  displaced.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Place Units:</strong> The player who did not move that
                  unit takes all of the displaced minis (both friendly and
                  enemy) and places them back on the battlefield.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Each mini must be placed in cohesion with its unit leader.

                    <li>
                      If a unit leader was displaced, it must be placed at
                      speed-1 of its original position. After the leader is
                      placed, any minis of that unit that are not in cohesion
                      are placed in cohesion; this could cause a mini that was
                      not displaced to be moved.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      When placing a displaced mini, it cannot be placed in base
                      contact with an enemy mini.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      When placing a displaced mini, it must remain on its
                      original elevation, if possible.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Gain Suppression:</strong> Each unit that had one or
                  more minis displaced gains one suppression token.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      A unit cannot gain more than one suppression token due to
                      being displaced in a single activation, even if it is
                      displaced multiple times that activation.
                    </li>

                      A droid trooper unit cannot be suppressed, though it gains

              <h4>Embark and Disembark (Unit Keyword)</h4>
              <p>
                Embarking and disembarking are types of moves that allow a unit
                to enter or exit a vehicle with the
                <strong class="keyword-reference">transport x</strong> or
                <strong class="keyword-reference">light transport x</strong>
                keyword.
              </p>
              <p>
                To embark into a transport with the
                <strong class="keyword-reference">transport x: open</strong>
                keyword, a unit uses 1 action to perform a speed-1 move that
                puts its unit leader into base contact with a friendly vehicle
                that can transport that type of unit.
              </p>
              <p>
                To embark into a transport with the
                <strong class="keyword-reference">transport x: closed</strong>
                keyword, a unit spends its entire activation to perform a
                speed-1 move that puts its unit leader into base contact with a
                friendly vehicle that can transport that type of unit.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then, the unit is removed from the battlefield and a pair of ID
                tokens are placed, one near the base of the vehicle and one next
                to the unit, to indicate that the unit is being transported by
                that vehicle, and its activation ends.
              </p>
              <p>
                To disembark, a unit that is being transported uses 1 action to
                place its unit leader in base contact with the vehicle and then
                performs a speed–1 move with the unit.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  When a unit embarks, any tokens that unit has are moved off
                  the battlefield with the unit. That unit still has those
                  tokens.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When a unit disembarks, any tokens that were moved off the
                  battlefield with the unit are placed back on the battlefield
                  next to the unit. That unit still has those tokens.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When a unit disembarks, if the vehicle that is transporting
                  that unit has performed more than one standard move or reverse
                  during the current round, disembarking uses that unit’s entire
                  activation and it cannot perform additional actions or any
                  free actions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A unit that is disembarking cannot be placed into base contact
                  with any enemy units.

                    <li>
                      A unit leader cannot be placed into base contact with an

                      While performing the speed–1 move, a unit cannot move into

                  A unit cannot both embark and disembark during the same

              <p>
                An emplacement trooper is a type of unit. It is a subtype of the
                trooper unit type.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Any game effect that targets or applies to troopers can target
                  or apply to emplacement troopers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Emplacement trooper units follow the same rules as trooper
                  units with the following exceptions:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Emplacement troopers are affixed to either a medium,

                    </li>
                    <li>
                      When an emplacement trooper performs a standard move, the
                      player inserts the movement tool into the front notch of
                      the mini’s base.

                    <li>
                      Emplacement troopers can obscure other minis, and provide
                      light cover when doing so.
                    </li>
                    <li>Emplacement troopers cannot climb or clamber.</li>

                      When an emplacement trooper withdraws, it can perform free
                      actions and use abilities. It must still spend all
                      available actions and performs a speed-1 move.

                In the End Phase, players prepare for the next round. In order
                to resolve the End Phase, players perform the following steps in
                order:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Discard Command Card:</strong> Each player discards
                  their revealed command card; it cannot be used again this
                  game.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      If a player used the “Standing Orders” command card or was
                      unable to play a command card this round, they will not
                      have a card to discard.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Remove Tokens:</strong> Players remove all aim, dodge,
                  and standby tokens from their units, as well as one
                  suppression token from each unit.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Update Order Pool and Promote:</strong> Each player
                  places one of their order tokens on each of their undefeated
                  units’ cards with a matching rank.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Excess order tokens are removed from the game. If all of a
                      player’s commanders were defeated, starting with the blue
                      player, players must promote a unit leader from one of
                      their trooper units to be a commander, placing the
                      commander token in the play area next to that mini. Then,
                      that unit’s original order token is discarded, and a
                      commander order token is placed on that unit’s card in its
                      place.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      In the rare instance where a player no longer has a
                      trooper unit to promote, they no longer have a commander
                      and cannot play command cards.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Advance Round Counter:</strong> The player who has the
                  round counter sets it so the next highest number is displayed;
                  that is the number of the next round. Then, that player passes
                  the round counter to their opponent.
                  <ul>
                    <li>After the sixth game round, the game ends.</li>

              <h4>Entourage: Unit Name (Unit Keyword)</h4>
              <p>
                The <strong class="keyword-reference">entourage</strong> keyword
                indicates that a unit is often accompanied or protected by
                another specific unit. The
                <strong class="keyword-reference">entourage</strong> keyword
                specifically states the name of this other unit. When building
                an army, if a player includes a unit with the
                <strong class="keyword-reference">entourage</strong> keyword,
                they may ignore the rank (but not points value) of a unit that
                has the name specified by the
                <strong class="keyword-reference">entourage</strong> keyword.
                Ignoring the rank of a unit means that the unit’s rank does not
                count against the rank restrictions for building an army. This
                may cause an army to have more units of a specific rank than the
                rules for building an army normally allow; because of the
                <strong class="keyword-reference">entourage</strong> keyword,
                such an army still meets the rules for building an army of that
                type.

                  the order <strong>must</strong> be issued to a unit that has

              <p>
                Not every hero is faultless and not every villain is unwavering.
                Some characters have critical flaws that come to light at the
                most inopportune times. Each unit that has the
                <strong class="keyword-reference">flawed</strong> keyword has a
                corresponding flaw card. During setup, that unit’s flaw card
                <strong>must</strong> be added to an opponent’s command hand.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the game, that opponent may play the flaw card according
                to the rules described on the card itself. During the End Phase,
                any flaw cards in play are discarded and their effects end.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A unit’s specific flaw card is identified by that unit’s name
                  appearing in the upper right of the flaw cad itself.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Flaw cards can be played only according to the rules on the
                  flaw card itself. Most flaw cards are played at the start of
                  the Command Phase.
                </li>
                <li>Flaw cards are not command cards.</li>
                <li>
                  Flaw cards are placed in an opponent’s command hand for the
                  sake of convenience. Effects that target an opponent’s command
                  hand or command cards <strong>cannot</strong> target or effect
                  a flaw card.

                <li>
                  If both players have a flaw card in their hand, at the start
                  of each phase the blue player must decide whether or not to
                  play a flaw card before the red player decides.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When a flaw card is discarded from play, it is placed in the
                  discard pile of the player that controls the associated unit.
                  This is to avoid the card being misplaced after a game.

                <strong class="keyword-reference">field commander</strong>, mark
                that unit with the commander token. That unit keeps its current

                <strong class="keyword-reference">field commander</strong>, that
                unit may be nominated as a commander when a neutral command card
                is layed. In addition, while that unit has a commander token,
                friendly units at range 1–3 may treat their courage value as 2

                A firing arc is the cone-shaped area formed by the firing-arc

              <ul>

                  The bases of some minis have firing-arc lines that players use
                  to determine firing arcs for that mini.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Each firing-arc line begins in the center of a mini’s base and
                  ends at the edge of a mini’s base.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      The firing arc between the two firing-arc lines that
                      extend to the front of a mini’s base is that mini’s front
                      firing arc. The two firing-arc lines that form the front
                      firing arc always have a notch between them.

                      The firing arc between the two firing-arc lines that
                      extend to the rear of a mini’s base is that mini’s rear
                      firing arc. The two firing-arc lines that form the rear
                      firing arc always have a notch between them.

                      The firing arc between the two firing-arc lines that
                      extend to the left of a mini’s base is one of that mini’s
                      side firing arcs, and the firing arc between the two
                      firingarc lines that extend to the right of a mini’s base
                      is that mini’s other side firing arc. Together these are
                      that mini’s side firing arcs. The firing arc lines that

                  If an effect provides a unit with a free action of a certain
                  type, such as a free attack action, performing that free
                  action does not count against that unit’s two actions per
                  activation, but is considered an action for the purposes of
                  game effects and therefore does not allow a unit to perform a
                  non-move action more than once during its activation.

                    He must either use the free card action before moving or

                A graffiti token represents a striking image or symbol painted
                onto the terrain of the battlefield. Graffiti tokens affect a

                      <strong>enemy</strong> graffiti token at range 1–2, it
                      <strong>must</strong> roll 1 fewer die, to a minimum of 1.

                  Graffiti tokens must be placed flat, either on the battlefield

              <h4>Height</h4>
              <p>
                Height is a vertical measurement of objects on a battlefield. An
                object’s height is measured using the range ruler.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  To measure an object’s height, a player places the end of the
                  range ruler flat on the battlefield’s surface as close to the
                  object as possible; the range ruler should be oriented
                  vertically. The segment of the range ruler that the top of the
                  object is at is equal to that object’s height.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      If the top of the object meets the line between two range
                      ruler segments without crossing that line, that object’s
                      height is equal to the lower range segment that the line
                      separates. Otherwise, the height of the object is equal to
                      the higher range segment that the line separates.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Some terrain may have multiple surfaces at various heights.
                  When determining the height of a surface for the purposes of
                  climbing or clambering, a player measures from the surface
                  their miniatures are on to the surface those minis are
                  climbing or clambering to.

                Not all repulsor vehicles are speeders, and many use their
                repulsors to hover in mid air, some only a short distance off
                the ground and others many meters above the battlefield.
                Repulsor vehicles that do not have the
                <strong class="keyword-reference">speeder x</strong> keyword
                will often have the
                <strong class="keyword-reference">hover</strong> keyword. Some
                droid trooper units also have the
                <strong class="keyword-reference">hover</strong> keyword. There
                are two versions of the
                <strong class="keyword-reference">hover</strong> keyword,
                <strong class="keyword-reference">hover: ground</strong> and
                <strong class="keyword-reference">hover: air x</strong>. Both
                versions allow the unit to perform the standby action and to
                reverse, even if it cannot normally perform that action or move.
                Additionally, if the unit’s base has side notches, the
                <strong class="keyword-reference">hover</strong> keyword allows
                it to strafe.

                  is treated as a ground vehicle by other units. This applies at

                      trooper units that are able to be displaced. It can move
                      through other repulsor vehicles but cannot move through

                      must still be placed as flat as possible on the
                      battlefield after moving. Not all terrain that a unit can
                      end their move on is perfectly flat and players should
                      agree before playing as to what terrain units cannot end
                      their movement on; however, as a general rule, if
                      overlapping a piece of terrain causes a mini to be
                      unstable or fall over, or causes the mini’s base to be at
                      an angle greater than 45 degrees, that mini cannot end a

                ID tokens help players keep track of multiple units of the same
                type that have different upgrade cards. When deploying such
                units, place a unique ID token near the base of the unit leader
                of each unit. Then, place each unit’s matching ID token on its
                corresponding card.

                During the Command Phase, when it is a player’s turn to resolve
                their revealed command card, they nominate one of their
                commanders on the battlefield. That commander issues orders to
                the number and type of units presented on the revealed command
                card.
              </p>
              <ul>

                  A unit needs to fulfill the following criteria to be issued an
                  order:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      The unit must be of a type presented on the player’s
                      revealed command card.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The unit must be at range 1–3 of the player’s nominated
                      commander.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The unit cannot have already received an order during the
                      current game round.

                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  When a unit is issued an order, a player places an order token
                  that matches the faction and rank of the unit receiving the
                  orders near that unit on the battlefield; the player places
                  the order token so its rank is faceup.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When playing an operative’s command card, the player does not
                  nominate a commander; instead they nominate the operative, and
                  that operative issues orders.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If a player does not have a commander or operative on the
                  battlefield, that player cannot play a command card during the
                  Command Phase.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Orders are issued one at a time, in an order chosen by the
                  player who controls the unit that is issuing the orders. Any
                  game effects that triggers when or after an order is issued
                  are resolved one at a time, when or after that order is
                  issued, and before any other orders are issued.
                </li>
                <li>
                  During the Command Phase, a unit can be issued an order only
                  once, even if a game effect causes that order to be removed or
                  issued to another unit instead.

                When practicing the Juyo lightsaber form, a form strongly

                their inner rage, hatred, and pain to enhance and fuel their
                combat prowess. While a unit with the
                <strong class="keyword-reference">juyo mastery</strong> keyword
                has one or more wound tokens, it can perform one additional

                  The effects of
                  <strong class="keyword-reference">juyo mastery</strong> apply
                  even during an activation in which a unit is suppressed. A
                  unit that is suppressed and under the effects of

                  wounded at the start of its activation, but becomes wounded

                  If a unit with

              <h4>Keywords</h4>
              <p>A keyword is an ability possessed by units or weapons.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  There are two types of keywords: unit keywords and weapon
                  keywords.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      A unit keyword is an inherent ability of a unit and it is
                      presented on a unit’s card or added to a unit by an
                      upgrade card.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      A weapon keyword is an inherent ability of a weapon and is
                      presented as part of a weapon on either a unit’s card or
                      an upgrade card.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Each unit keyword provides a unit with an ability, including
                  the timing of when the ability is used as well as the effect
                  of the ability.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Each weapon keyword adds an ability to the attack pool in
                  which it is included.
                </li>
                <li>
                  All keywords with a numerical value (an “x” value) are
                  cumulative with themselves. This includes both weapon keywords
                  and unit keywords (including unit keywords that are card
                  actions, such as the
                  <strong class="keyword-reference">jump x</strong>
                  keyword).<br /><br /><em
                    >For example, an AT-ST has the arsenal 2 keyword; if that
                    AT-ST uses the free card action on the General Weiss upgrade
                    card to gain arsenal 2, that AT-ST now has arsenal 4.
                    Similarly, when a Stormtrooper unit composed of four minis
                    performs an attack, if each mini chooses to use the weapon
                    on an equipped Impact Grenades upgrade card, the attack pool
                    would consist of four instances of impact 1, and thus the
                    attack pool would have impact 4.</em

                </li>
                <li>
                  The front of each unit card provides reminder text of each of
                  that unit’s keywords. The back of each unit card provides
                  reminder text for each of that unit’s weapon keywords.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      The reminder text is not an exhaustive description of the
                      rules for a keyword. Rather, it is there to help players
                      remember how and when to resolve each keyword. If a player
                      has questions about how a keyword works, that player
                      should refer to that keyword’s glossary entry.

              <h4>Line of Sight</h4>
              <p>
                Line of sight is used to determine if one mini can see another
                mini. A player determines line of sight from the perspective of
                a mini, using a viewpoint where the center of the mini’s base
                meets the top of the mini’s sculpt. If a player can see part of
                an opponent’s mini, which includes that mini’s base, from that
                viewpoint, that player’s mini has line of sight to that
                opponent’s mini.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If a mini does not have line of sight to another mini, line of
                  sight is blocked.

                    <li>
                      Pieces of terrain and vehicles can block line of sight.

                    <li>
                      Trooper minis do not block line of sight. When determining
                      line of sight, if a player cannot see a mini because it is
                      concealed by one or more troopers on the battlefield, and
                      that player could otherwise see the mini, that player’s
                      mini has line of sight to the mini that is concealed by
                      one or more troopers.

                  During an attack, each mini in the attacker can contribute
                  dice to the attack pool if that mini has line of sight to
                  <strong>any</strong> mini in the defender.
                </li>
                <li>
                  During an attack, if line of sight to a mini in the defender
                  is blocked from all minis in the attacker, that mini in the
                  defender cannot suffer wounds.
                </li>
                <li>A mini cannot block its own line of sight.</li>

                  When determining line of sight from an E-Web Heavy Blaster

                  the snowtrooper who is firing the E-Web, regardless of whether
                  it is directly over the center of the base.

              <h4>Melee</h4>
              <p>
                Melee represents close combat between opposing units. When two
                miniatures from opposing players’ units are in base contact,
                those units are in a melee.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  If two trooper units are in a melee, those units are engaged.
                  Any unit type can be in a melee, but only troopers can be
                  engaged.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When a unit performs an attack against a unit that it is in a
                  melee with, that attack is a melee attack. Melee attacks
                  follow the same rules as ranged attacks with the following
                  exceptions:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      The attacker can use only weapons that have the melee
                      (<img

                    <li>
                      The target of the attack must be in the same melee as the
                      attacker.

                <li>
                  If a unit has a melee weapon, it can start a melee by moving
                  into base contact with an enemy miniature. To start a melee, a
                  player must follow these steps in order:

                  <strong>Move Unit Leader:</strong> The player performs a move,
                  moving their unit leader into base contact with an enemy mini.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Move Other Minis:</strong> Maintaining cohesion, the
                  player places each other mini in the unit that started the
                  melee into base contact with enemy minis that belong to the
                  same enemy unit that their unit leader is now in melee with.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Opponent Moves Minis:</strong> Maintaining cohesion,
                  the player’s opponent moves any of their own minis that belong
                  to the unit that is now in a melee (that are not already in
                  base contact with an enemy mini) into base contact with minis
                  from the unit that started the melee.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      If the opponent’s unit does not have a melee weapon, the
                      opponent does not move their minis into base contact with
                      the unit that started the melee.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  A unit cannot move in such a way that its minis would be
                  placed in base contact with multiple enemy units.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      It is possible for a unit to be in a melee with multiple
                      enemy units if another unit joins later.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  A unit that does not have a melee weapon cannot start a melee.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When moving minis into base contact with enemy minis after a
                  melee has been started, if there is not space to place a mini
                  in base contact with an enemy mini in the same melee, that
                  mini must still be placed in cohesion.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Minis that are not in base contact with an enemy mini can
                  still contribute to a melee attack if the unit to which that
                  mini belongs is in a melee.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Whenever there are minis that are not in base contact with an
                  enemy mini but those minis have a melee weapon and the unit to
                  which they belong is in a melee, those minis must be placed in
                  base contact with an enemy mini in the same melee as their
                  unit if possible. This can happen when minis in a melee suffer
                  wounds and are defeated, creating space for other minis that
                  were not previously in base contact to be placed in base
                  contact.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      If both players own minis that are not in base contact
                      with an enemy mini and should be, the player that is
                      currently activating a unit or has most recently activated
                      a unit (even if that unit is not the unit with minis that
                      should be placed in base contact with enemy minis) should
                      move their minis into base contact with enemy minis before
                      the other player does so. If neither play has activated a
                      unit yet this round, the blue player should move their
                      minis first.

                    <li>
                      Minis that are no longer in base contact should always be
                      placed back into base contact with an enemy mini if able,
                      even if each enemy mini that was in base contact has just
                      been defeated. This can happen when the defending unit
                      does not have a melee weapon and not all defending minis
                      were in base contact with an enemy mini.<br /><br /><em
                        >For example, Luke Skywalker is in base contact with an
                        enemy 74-Z Speeder Bike mini, while another mini from
                        the same unit is not in base contact with Luke
                        Skywalker. After performing an attack, Luke Skywalker
                        defeats the enemy 74-Z Speeder Bike mini and is no
                        longer is base contact with an enemy mini. Because there
                        is another 74-Z Speeder Bike mini from that unit, Luke
                        Skywalker should immediately be placed into base contact
                        with that mini.</em

                      If for any reason minis cannot be placed back into base
                      contact with an enemy mini and none of the minis belonging
                      to that unit are in base contact with an enemy mini, those

              <h4>Movement</h4>
              <p>Each unit can move about the battlefield in multiple ways.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The primary way that units move is by performing a move
                  action. When a unit performs a move action, it performs a
                  standard move, reverse, strafe, pivot, climb, clamber, embark,
                  or disembark.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To perform a standard move, a player performs the following
                  steps:
                </li>
              </ul>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Take Movement Tool:</strong> The player chooses a
                  movement tool.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Each unit has a maximum speed of one, two, or three, which
                      is represented by a number of red bars on the unit’s card.
                      When a unit performs a standard move, it uses a movement
                      tool with a value equal to or less than its maximum speed.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Place Movement Tool:</strong> The player places the
                  movement tool against the moving unit’s base, according to the
                  type of base:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Unnotched Base:</strong> The player places one end
                      of the movement tool flush against any portion of the unit
                      leader mini’s base.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Notched Base:</strong> The player places one end
                      of the movement tool into the front notch of the vehicle’s
                      base.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Adjust Movement Tool:</strong> The player can adjust
                  the movement tool at its joint, bending it as they desire. The
                  movement tool creates a path along which the mini will move.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Execute Full or Partial Move:</strong> The player
                  executes either a full or partial move.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Full:</strong> Holding the movement tool in place,
                      the player lifts up the unit leader mini and moves it
                      along the path of the movement tool, keeping the mini’s
                      base centered in relation to the width of the tool. Then,
                      if the mini has an unnotched base, the player places the
                      mini’s base flush against the other end of the movement
                      tool; if the mini has a notched base, the player places
                      the mini so the other end of the movement tool is inserted
                      into the rear notch of the mini’s base.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Partial:</strong> Holding the movement tool in
                      place, the player lifts up the unit leader mini and moves
                      it along the path of the movement tool, keeping the mini’s
                      base centered in relation to the width of the tool. Then,
                      the player places the mini anywhere along the path created
                      by the movement tool, moving the movement tool out of the
                      way and placing the mini on the battlefield. When placing
                      a mini with a notched base during a partial move, the unit
                      must be placed such that the central axis of the mini’s
                      front and back notches is parallel to the section of the
                      movement tool the mini reached at the furthest part of its
                      move.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Establish Cohesion:</strong> The player places all
                  minis of the moving unit that are not the unit leader in
                  cohesion with the unit leader. See
                  <a href="#cohesion" class="link-to-c">Cohesion</a>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      When a notched base mini is placed in cohesion, its base
                      must be oriented in the exact same direction as the unit
                      leader’s base.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  During a unit’s activation, it is possible for a unit to
                  perform multiple move actions. Unlike other actions, a unit is
                  not limited to only one move action per activation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  While moving a mini along a path created by a movement tool,
                  if the base of the mini is impeded by an object, that mini
                  must stop its movement prematurely unless the mini can legally
                  move through, over, or on top of the obstructing object.
                </li>

                <li>
                  While performing a standard move, a reverse, or a strafe, if
                  it is obvious that the mini will be unimpeded while moving
                  along the path created by the movement tool, the mini can be
                  placed directly at its final destination.
                </li>
                <li>
                  While moving a unit, if a movement tool cannot lie flat on the
                  battlefield, the player can hold the tool above any objects
                  that prevent the tool from lying flat, or mark the objects’
                  positions and move them out of the way while performing the
                  move.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A mini can move into base contact with an enemy mini only if
                  the unit performing the move has a melee weapon and is
                  entering into a melee with that enemy unit.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If a unit performs a move that causes any part of its unit
                  leader's base to be outside of the battlefield, including
                  while moving along a movement tool, that unit is defeated.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Unless a unit is able to displace other minis, the final
                  position of a unit after a move cannot overlap the bases of
                  other minis.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The final position of a unit after a move cannot overlap
                  objective or condition tokens.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The bases of minis can partially overhang ledges, as long as
                  the mini is stable and is not precariously placed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A unit must be placed as flat as possible on the battlefield
                  after performing any type of move. Not all terrain that a unit
                  could end their move on top of is perfectly flat and players
                  should agree before playing as to what terrain units cannot
                  end their movement on; however, as a general rule, if
                  overlapping a piece of terrain causes a mini to be unstable or
                  fall over, or causes the mini’s base to be at an angle greater
                  than 45 degrees, that mini cannot end a move in that position.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If a game effect allows or forces a unit to perform a
                  “speed-x” move, that unit performs a full or partial standard
                  move with a speed equal to or lower than “x.” Climbing,
                  clambering, embarking, disembarking, reversing, strafing, and

                      mini’s base. When finishing a full move, they place the
                      rear notch of the mini’s base onto the end of the movement
                      tool.

                    <li>
                      When performing a reverse, they begin by placing the start
                      of the movement tool into the rear notch of the mini’s
                      base. When finishing a full reverse, they place the front
                      notch of the mini’s base onto the end of the movement

                <li>
                  When a mini with a notched base is placed in cohesion, its
                  base must be oriented in the exact same direction as the unit
                  leader’s base.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When a mini with a notched base climbs or clambers, its base
                  must be oriented in the exact same direction as it was before
                  it climbed or clambered.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The space created by the notch in a mini's base should be
                  treated as a part of that mini's base by other minis.
                  Therefore, no mini’s base may be placed inside the notches of
                  another mini’s base.

                critical weakness or flaw. Various effects can cause enemy units
                to gain observation tokens. During an attack, the attacking unit
                can spend any observation tokens that belong to the defending
                unit. The attacker rerolls one attack die for each observation

                icon indicates that a unit has the rank of operative. Operatives
                are powerful villains and heroes, but they rarely issue orders
                to other units. When building a standard army, a player may
                include up to two operative units.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Each operative has several command cards specific to that
                  operative that can only be used if that operative is included
                  in an army.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Operative-specific command cards are identified by the
                      name of that operative appearing below the name of the
                      command card.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  When playing an operative’s command card, the player does not
                  nominate a commander; instead they nominate the operative, and
                  that operative issues orders.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When playing a non-operative-specific command card, a player
                  cannot nominate an operative.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Any units indicated on an operative’s command card can be
                  issued orders only if they are at range 1–3 of the nominated
                  operative. A nominated operative is at range 1–3 of itself.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If all of a players commanders have been defeated, an
                  operative can be promoted to be a new commander. If promoted
                  in this way, it loses the rank of operative and can be
                  nominated as a commander and can issue orders using
                  non-operative-specific command cards during the Command Phase.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When an operative is defeated, their operative-specific
                  command cards are not discarded from the player's command
                  hand, even though they can no longer be played.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When a friendly unit is checking whether it is panicked, it
                  cannot use an operative's courage value.
                </li>

              <h4>Order Pool</h4>
              <p>
                During the Command Phase, each player creates an order pool that
                consists of the order tokens that the player did not issue while
                resolving their command card.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  When activating a unit during the Activation Phase, a player
                  can choose to take an order token at random from their order
                  pool.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Then, the player activates a unit with a rank that
                      corresponds to the rank on the order token they took.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  It is recommended that players create their order pool by
                  placing their order tokens in an opaque bag or container;
                  however, players can also create their order pool by placing
                  their order tokens facedown in a randomized stack near the
                  battlefield.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If a player draws a token that does not match the rank of a
                  unit they have in play, that token is removed from the order
                  pool and a new one is drawn.

              <h4>Order Tokens</h4>
              <p>
                Each unit has an order token that matches both its faction and
                its rank. Players use these order tokens to activate their
                units.

                <li>
                  One side of an order token depicts the unit’s faction:
                  Galactic Empire or Rebel Alliance. The other side of the order
                  token depicts the unit’s rank: commander (<img

                </li>
                <li>
                  During the Command Phase, when a player issues orders to a
                  unit by playing a command card, that player places an order
                  token displaying that unit’s rank on the battlefield next to
                  that unit; the player places the order token so its rank side
                  is faceup.
                </li>
                <li>
                  After issuing orders to units during the Command Phase, a
                  player places any order tokens not on the battlefield into
                  that player’s order pool.
                </li>
                <li>
                  During the Activation Phase, a player either activates a
                  friendly unit with a faceup order token or takes a random
                  order token from their order pool and activates a friendly
                  unit with a matching rank that does not have an order token.
                </li>
                <li>
                  After a player activates their unit, they place that unit’s
                  order token near that unit on the battlefield so its rank side
                  is facedown and its faction side is faceup. This facedown
                  order token indicates that the unit has activated during this
                  game round.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When a unit is defeated, its order token is removed from the
                  game, either when an order token is drawn from the pool that
                  does not match the rank of any unactivated unit on the
                  battlefield, or in the End Phase.

                  After the “Rally” step of a unit’s activation, if the unit has
                  a number of suppression tokens that is equal to or greater
                  than double its courage value, that unit is panicked.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      If a unit is at range 1–3 of a friendly commander, it may
                      use that commander’s courage value instead of its own when
                      checking if it is panicked.

                  When a unit becomes panicked, it gains a panic token. The

                  will remain with the unit as it moves around the battlefield.

                <li>
                  After the “Rally” step of a unit’s activation, if that unit is
                  panicked, it can perform only one action instead of two, and
                  that action must be a move action toward the nearest
                  battlefield edge.

                <li>
                  When performing its move action, a panicked unit must attempt
                  to move off of the battlefield as efficiently as possible.
                  That is, the unit must move the entire length of the movement
                  tool in the direction of the battlefield edge to which that
                  unit is closest. If a unit can move off the battlefield more
                  efficiently by moving along an indirect path that avoids
                  terrain, the unit should move along that path. After the unit
                  leader is moved, however, any remaining minis in the unit are
                  placed in cohesion as normal. If the unit leader leaves the

              <h4>Pivot</h4>
              <p>
                A pivot is a type of movement that allows a mini with a notched
                base to change the orientation of its base.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  When a mini pivots, that mini can rotate its base up to
                  90&#176; in either direction.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To pivot, a player rotates the unit leader’s base around the
                  base’s center point. The center point of the unit leader’s
                  base should remain in place throughout the pivot.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If a notched-base unit contains multiple miniatures, each mini
                  in the unit must pivot so the orientation of its base matches
                  the orientation of the unit leader’s base.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A unit can pivot while in difficult terrain without suffering
                  any penalties.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If a game effect triggers by a unit moving, that game effect
                  triggers by pivoting.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When a mini with a non-round base pivots, it cannot overlap
                  other mini’s bases, unless it is able to displace those minis.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When a ground vehicle pivots, if it has a non-round base, it
                  displaces friendly and enemy trooper minis.
                </li>
