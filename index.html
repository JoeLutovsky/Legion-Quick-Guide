              <h4>Abilities</h4>
              <p>
                Cards contain abilities that either grant passive effects to
                units or can be triggered for specific effects.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Abilities on unit cards are presented as keywords. The front
                  of each unit card provides reminder text for that unit’s unit
                  keywords. The back of each unit card provides reminder text
                  for that unit’s weapon keywords.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Reminder text is not an exhaustive description of the
                      rules for a keyword. If a player has questions about how a
                      keyword works, that player should refer to that keyword’s
                      glossary entry.

                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Upgrade cards and command cards also contain abilities in the
                  form of keywords.
                </li>

                  one of the two actions that a unit can perform during its
                  activation.
                </li>

                  />) icon, that ability can be performed as a free card action
                  in addition to the two actions that a unit can perform during
                  its activation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Some cards must be exhausted as a cost to perform the ability
                  on the card. Such a card contains an exhaust (<img
                    class="game-icon"

                      If a card that has an exhaust icon is already exhausted, a
                      player cannot resolve that card’s ability until the card
                      is readied.

                    <li>
                      A unit can ready any number of its exhausted cards by
                      performing a recover action.

                  If the timing of an ability uses the word “after,” that
                  ability’s effect occurs immediately after the described timing
                  event has occurred.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the timing of an ability uses the word “when,” that
                  ability’s effect occurs at the exact moment of the described
                  timing event.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the timing of an ability uses the word “while,” that
                  ability’s effect occurs during a specific step of the
                  described timing event.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If an ability allows a unit to trigger an effect after it
                  moves, the ability can be triggered after any type of move,
                  but not after the unit withdraws, unless that unit is a
                  creature or emplacement trooper.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If an effect provides a unit with either a move or an attack
                  that is not an action or free action, performing that move or
                  attack does not trigger abilities that occur after move or
                  attack actions are performed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If an effect allows a unit to gain an aim, dodge, or standby
                  token, that effect is different than performing an aim, dodge,
                  or standby action and does not trigger abilities that occur
                  after those actions are performed.

                  game effects and therefore does not allow a unit to perform

                  If an effect provides a unit with a free action without
                  specifying a type of action, that unit may perform any action
                  that it could normally perform. Performing that free action
                  does not count against that unit’s two actions per activation,
                  but is considered an action for the purposes of game effects

                  multiple attacks through the use of command cards or other
                  abilities. If an effect provides a unit with an attack during
                  its activation, and that attack is not an action or free
                  action, performing that attack does not count toward a unit’s
                  limit of a single attack action per activation. It is not an
                  action and therefore does not count against that unit’s two
                  actions per activation and does not trigger abilities that
                  occur after actions are performed.

              <h4>Attack</h4>
              <p>Units can perform attacks to attempt to defeat enemy units.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A unit typically performs an attack by performing an attack
                  action during its activation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  During a unit’s activation, it is possible for a unit to
                  perform more than one attack through the use of card abilities
                  or other game effects; however, that unit can only perform one
                  attack action during a single activation, regardless of
                  whether it is an attack action or a free attack action.
                </li>
                <li>
                  During an attack, the unit that is performing the attack is
                  the attacker and the target of the attack is the defender.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Multiple units can be chosen as defenders (see step 3).
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  There are two types of attacks: ranged and melee.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      During a ranged attack, the attacker and defender are not
                      in a melee, and the attacker can use only weapons that
                      have a blue range (<img

                      During a melee attack, the attacker and defender are in a
                      melee, and the attacker can use only weapons that have a
                      red melee (<img

                <li>
                  Command cards, unit abilities, and other game effects can
                  allow units to perform attacks. The card granting the attack
                  will specify whether the attack is an attack action, a free
                  attack action, or neither.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To perform an attack, a player resolves the following steps:

              </ul>

                  <strong class="keyword-reference">Declare Defender:</strong>
                  The attacking player chooses one enemy unit to attack; this
                  enemy unit is now the defender. Then, the attacking player
                  measures the range from the attacker’s unit leader to the
                  closest miniature of the defender to determine the attack’s
                  range.

                  The attack pool consists of all the dice the attacker will

                      the defender.

                      attacker can choose one weapon from each eligible mini to
                      contribute to the attack pool. To choose a weapon, the
                      attacker must meet all requirements indicated by that
                      weapon’s keywords, and that weapon’s range must include
                      the range of the attack, as determined from the attacker’s
                      unit leader to the closest mini of the defender.

                      eligible mini that chose a weapon, the attacker gathers
                      the number and type of dice depicted on that weapon and
                      places them on the battlefield near the defender.

                  the attack pool, the player may repeat steps 1–2, forming a
                  separate attack pool with the new weapons.

              <h4>Attack Pool</h4>
              <p>
                An attack pool is a number of dice generated from weapons that
                are being used against a single target during an attack.
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Each weapon that is used during an attack contributes one or
                  more dice to an attack pool.
                </li>
                <li>
                  During an attack, the attacker can create multiple attack
                  pools to attack multiple defenders. However, only one attack
                  pool can be assigned to each defender.
                </li>
                <li>
                  An attack pool can consist of dice from different weapons, but
                  all weapons with an identical name must contribute their dice
                  to the same attack pool.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A weapon can only contribute its dice to an attack pool if the
                  following restrictions are met:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      The range of the attack is equal to or greater than the
                      weapons’ minimum range and equal to or less than the
                      weapon’s maximum range.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The miniature using the weapon has line of sight to at
                      least one mini in the defending unit.
                    </li>
                    <li>If the weapon can exhaust, it must be readied.</li>
                    <li>
                      To add a weapon with the
                      <strong class="keyword-reference">fixed: x</strong>
                      keyword to the attack pool, the defender must be inside
                      the specified firing arc of the attacking mini.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Each weapon that contributes dice to an attack pool also
                  applies its keywords to that attack pool.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      If a weapon has a keyword that allows a player to modify
                      one or more dice in the attack pool, the player can use
                      that effect to modify any dice in the attack pool, not
                      just the dice that this weapon contributed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If a weapon has a keyword that changes how the results of
                      the attack roll affects the defender, the entire attack
                      roll affects the defender in that way, not just dice that
                      the weapon that has that keyword contributed.<br /><br />

              <p>Each miniature is affixed to a base.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Most trooper minis are affixed to small round bases.</li>
                <li>
                  Creature and emplacement trooper minis are affixed to notched

                <li>
                  Repulsor vehicle minis are affixed to notched bases by clear
                  plastic stands.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The orientation of a mini affixed to a small round base has no
                  gameplay implications. A player can freely rotate a mini
                  affixed to such a base during its movement.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A mini affixed to a notched base cannot be rotated freely;
                  during its movement, it must either pivot or move along the
                  movement tool, keeping the notches in the base aligned with
                  the movement tool.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The space created by the notch in a mini's base should be
                  treated as a part of that mini's base by other minis.
                  Therefore, no mini’s base may be placed inside the notches of
                  another mini’s base.

              <h4>Base Contact</h4>
              <p>
                Base contact refers to a miniature’s base physically touching
                something on the battlefield, typically a piece of terrain,
                another mini, or an objective token.
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  If the bases of two minis are touching each other, those minis
                  are in base contact.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If a mini’s base is touching a piece of terrain or an
                  objective token, that mini is in base contact with that
                  terrain or token.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Friendly minis from different units can be in base contact
                  with each other.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Minis cannot be in base contact with minis from enemy units,
                  unless the unit leader has a melee weapon (󲉫), in which case
                  the unit leader can perform a move into base contact with a
                  mini from an enemy unit to start a melee.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Because a mini’s base can overhang a ledge or be placed askew
                  on top of uneven terrain, there are sometimes situations in
                  which an another mini cannot be placed into physical base
                  contact with the first mini because of a slight difference in
                  elevation between the two bases. In these situations, if two
                  conditions are met, those minis are treated as if they are in
                  base contact. These conditions are as follows:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      First, when viewed from above, there is no space between
                      the two minis bases, such that if they were not on
                      differing elevations or they were both flat on the
                      battlefield, their bases would be touching.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Second, the vertical space separating the two bases is
                      less than the thickness of a standard
                      <em>STAR WARS: LEGION</em> base.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If these two conditions are met, minis in this situation
                      are considered to be in base contact and follow all the
                      normal rules for being in base contact.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  If a player is attempting to move a mini into base contact
                  with another mini and those minis are blocked from being
                  placed in base contact by the non-base portion of either mini,
                  the payer that is moving the mini may alter that mini’s final
                  position, within an acceptable margin, such that the minis are
                  placed in base contact.
                  <!--For further rules, see
                  "Margin of Error" on page 11-->
                </li>
                <li>
                  Units cannot be placed into or move into base contact with an
                  enemy mini during Setup.

                The Payload objective card requires two bomb cart miniatures. A
                bomb cart mini consists of a repulsor pallet miniature affixed
                to a 50mm notched base with 1 to 2 bombs, or similarly sized
                minis, placed on top of the pallet. When playing a game with the
                Payload objective card, each player may supply their own bomb
                cart. Or, if one player has supplied both bomb carts, the other
                player should choose which of the two bomb carts is theirs to
                use for that game.

              <p>
                Each piece of terrain chosen while resolving the Payload
                objective card must be touching the battlefield directly.

                  A bomb cart mini can move through all units, friendly and

                    <li>
                      A bomb cart mini can move through a group of friendly and

                keyword can choose a friendly trooper unit at range 1 and in

                suppression token.

              <h4>Card Actions</h4>
              <p>
                A card action is a type of action. If an ability is preceded by
                a card action (<img
                  src="img/legion-action.png"
                  class="game-icon"
                />) icon, that ability is a card action.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Each card action is a unique action; a unit can perform
                  different card actions during its activation. However, a unit
                  cannot perform the same card action more than once during its
                  activation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If a card action provides a unit with either a move or an
                  attack that is <strong>not</strong> treated as a move action
                  or an attack action, performing that move or attack is
                  different than performing a move action or attack action, even
                  though the result is the same.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Some card actions are treated as other types of actions, such
                  as a move action or an attack action. This is indicated in the
                  text of the card action itself. When a unit performs that card
                  action, treat that action as the type of action indicated in
                  its text, as well as a card action, for the purposes of all
                  gameplay effects and abilities, including triggering other
                  abilities that occur after the indicated action.<br /><br />
                  <em>
                    For example, after performing a move, if Darth Vader is
                    equipped with the Saber Throw upgrade card, he can use the
                    relentless ability to perform a ranged attack using the
                    Saber Throw card action.</em

                </li>
                <li>
                  Card actions can allow units to gain aim, dodge, and standby
                  tokens. If a card action specifically instructs a unit to gain
                  an aim, dodge, or standby token, that effect is different than
                  performing an aim, dodge, or standby action and therefore does
                  not trigger abilities that occur after aim, dodge, or standby
                  actions are performed.

                Climbing and clambering are types of movement that allow a unit
                to move vertically onto or over a piece of elevated terrain.
                While clambering, a unit might suffer damage.

                      leader on at the end of this movement and the unit can
                      maintain cohesion, a unit can spend two actions to safely
                      move vertically up or down a distance up to height 1. At
                      the end of this move, the unit leader is placed on the
                      flat surface at the top or bottom of the vertical
                      structure, as close to the edge as possible.

                      maintain cohesion, a unit can spend one action to move
                      vertically up or down a distance up to height 1, or two
                      actions to move up or down up to height 2. At the end of
                      this move, the unit leader is placed on the flat surface
                      at the top or bottom of the vertical structure, as close
                      to the edge as possible.

                      white defense dice if the unit moved up to height 2. For

                        <li>
                          This roll is made after moving the unit leader but
                          before placing the other minis in cohesion.

                      such an apparatus, it does not roll dice or suffer wounds.
                      These features should be clearly defined during setup.

                  If a trooper unit leader is in base contact with a piece of

                    <li>
                      To clamber over a vertical piece of terrain without a flat
                      surface on top, a unit can spend
                      <strong>two</strong> actions to move over the terrain. At
                      the end of this move, the unit leader is placed on a flat
                      surface at the bottom of the other side of the vertical
                      structure, as close to the structure as possible.

                    <li>
                      After a unit clambers in this way, roll two white defense

                </li>
                <li>
                  After the unit leader climbs or clambers, each other mini is
                  placed in cohesion with that leader as normal.

                    <li>
                      Minis in the same unit can be placed on different vertical
                      levels, but each mini must be within height 1 of its unit
                      leader.

                <li>
                  When measuring cohesion between two minis that are placed on
                  different vertical levels, a player should measure from the
                  unit leader to each mini using the speed-1 movement template,
                  measuring from a view above the battlefield as if the two
                  minis are on the same vertical level.

                    <li>
                      When separated by vertical distances, the position of a
                      mini from the position of their unit leader must also be
                      within the distance of a legal climb move. If a unit
                      leader is on top of elevated terrain, any minis in that
                      unit that are below their unit leader must be in base
                      contact with that terrain such that moving between the
                      position of the leader and the position of any mini in the
                      unit is a legal climb move.
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          For the distance between a mini’s position and its
                          unit leader’s position to be a legal climb move, it
                          must be height 1 or lower.
                        </li>

                    <li>
                      After climbing or clambering, the unit leader will by
                      default be on the edge of the terrain closest to the point
                      with which it was in base contact before climbing or
                      clambering. Minis not placed on the same edge of the
                      terrain as the leader must be placed in base contact with
                      the terrain and as close as possible to this point.

                      clambered, or lower than the level to which the unit
                      leader climbed or clambered if the unit leader moved
                      downwards.

                      unit leader, unless that mini’s unit leader has just
                      climbed or clambered. Minis can always be placed onto the

                  A unit does not have to climb or clamber to move up a gradual
                  slope such as a hill. As a general rule, if a miniature can be
                  placed on a slope without falling over, units can move up that
                  slope by performing a standard move. Players should clearly

                  When a unit climbs or clambers, the bases of the minis in the

                  stable and is not precariously placed. If there is not room to
                  place a unit leader’s base on the surface that the unit is
                  climbing or clambering onto, or if any mini’s base cannot be
                  placed legally and maintain cohesion, that unit cannot perform
                  that climb or clamber action.

                  When a mini with a notched base climbs or clambers, its base

              <p>
                A clone trooper is a type of unit. It is a subtype of the
                trooper unit type.

                  Any game effect that targets or applies to troopers can target
                  or apply to clone troopers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Clone trooper units follow the same rules as trooper units

                    <li>
                      A clone trooper unit can spend the aim, dodge, and surge
                      tokens of friendly clone trooper units at range 1 and in
                      line of sight as if they were their own.

              <h4>Cohesion</h4>
              <p>
                Each non-leader miniature in a unit must be in cohesion with its
                unit leader.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  After a unit leader moves, is deployed to the battlefield, or
                  is displaced on the battlefield, each other mini in that unit
                  must be placed in cohesion with that unit leader.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A mini is in cohesion with its unit leader if the distance
                  between a mini and its unit leader is equal to or less than
                  the length of the speed-1 movement tool.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      If the base of a unit leader is touching one end of the
                      speed-1 movement tool, and the base of a different mini in
                      that unit is touching the other end of the speed-1
                      movement tool, those minis are at the maximum distance of
                      cohesion.

                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  When a notched base mini is placed in cohesion, its base must
                  be oriented in the exact same direction as the unit leader’s
                  base.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When placing a mini in cohesion, it cannot be placed in base

                <li>
                  When moving a unit leader, a player can push aside any minis
                  from that unit to make it easier to place the movement tool on
                  the battlefield.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If moving multiple units at the same time because of
                  displacement, a player can move the unit leaders from those
                  units first, and then place the remaining minis in cohesion
                  with their respective leaders.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When placing minis in cohesion, the bases of the minis in the
                  unit can partially overhang ledges, as long as the mini is
                  stable and is not precariously placed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When placing a mini in cohesion with its unit leader, that
                  mini must be placed such that the distance between the mini
                  and its unit leader could be made as a legal speed-1 move from
                  the final position of the unit leader.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      This means that when placing a mini in cohesion with its
                      unit leader it cannot be placed on the other side of
                      impassable terrain from its unit leader.

                    <li>
                      However, minis being placed in cohesion are considered to
                      be able to move through any enemy trooper minis with which
                      they are engaged.

                    <li>
                      Notched-based minis must obey this rule; however, the
                      speed-1 move between the mini’s position and the unit
                      leader’s position is determined as if both the mini and
                      the unit leader can pivot up to 180&#176; before and after
                      the move is measured.<br /><br /><em
                        >For example, a mini is placed such that the distance
                        between it and its unit leader is equal to or less than
                        the length of the speed-1 movement tool; however, there
                        is a piece of blocking terrain between the mini and its
                        unit leader. If the mini is placed in such a way that
                        there is a legal speed-1 move around the piece of
                        blocking terrain between the position of the mini and
                        the position of the unit leader, then cohesion is
                        maintained, but if there is not a legal speed-1 move
                        between the position of the mini and the position of the
                        leader, then the mini is not in cohesion.</em

                <li>
                  When separated by vertical distances, the position of a mini
                  from the position of its unit leader must also be a legal
                  climb move. If a unit leader is on top of elevated terrain,
                  any minis in that unit that are below their unit leader must
                  be in base contact with that terrain such that moving between
                  the position of the leader and the position of any mini in the
                  unit is a legal climb move.

                    <li>
                      In order for the distance between a mini’s position and
                      its unit leader’s position to be a legal climb move, it
                      must be height 1 or lower.

                    <li>
                      After climbing or clambering, the unit leader will by
                      default be on the edge of the terrain closest to the point
                      with which it was in base contact before climbing or
                      clambering. Minis not placed on the same edge of the
                      terrain as the leader must be placed in base contact with
                      the terrain edge and as close as possible to this point.

                <li>
                  When placing a trooper mini in cohesion, it cannot be placed
                  higher than the level to which its unit leader climbed or
                  clambered (or lower than the level to which its unit leader
                  climbed or clambered if the unit leader moved downwards).

                <li>
                  When placing a mini in cohesion, it cannot be placed onto a
                  <strong>different</strong> level of terrain than its unit
                  leader, unless that mini’s unit leader has just climbed or
                  clambered. Minis can always be placed onto the same level as
                  their unit leader when being placed in cohesion.

                      If a unit performs a move that ignores terrain of a

                      When a player returns a command card to their command hand

                  Some command cards contain weapon profiles. Typically there
                  are two ways these weapon profiles can be used: a unit
                  specified by the command card gains the weapon on the card and
                  can use it during its activation, or a unit specified by the
                  command card may perform an attack using the weapon on the
                  card at the end of its activation.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      If a unit gains a weapon from a command card, that weapon
                      is treated as though it is on the unit's unit card.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If a unit may perform an attack with a weapon on a command
                      card, it cannot use the
                      <strong class="keyword-reference">arsenal x</strong>
                      keyword to add additional weapons to the attack pool; the
                      attack must be made only with the weapon on the command
                      card. This does not apply to a weapon that a unit gains
                      via a command card, as that weapon is considered to be on
                      its unit card.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If a unit may perform an attack with a weapon on a command
                      card, it must be able to perform an attack of the type
                      specified by the range icon of the weapon. An engaged
                      trooper unit cannot perform ranged attacks, unless the
                      weapon has the

                      counterpart that is a part of that unit does not gain that
                      weapon, unless otherwise stated by a card effect.

                During the Command Phase, each player selects a command card
                from their hand and chooses a commander to issue orders to one
                or more units on the battlefield.<br /><br />
                To resolve the Command Phase, players perform the following

                  Each player secretly selects a command card from their hand
                  and places it facedown on the table. Then, both players
                  simultaneously reveal their cards.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      If a player does not have a commander or an operative on
                      the battlefield, they do not select or resolve a command

                      If both cards have the same number of pips, the player who
                      has the round counter rolls a red defense die (six-sided

                      If one player plays a command card and their opponent does

                  Starting with the player who has priority, each player

                  issues orders with that unit. The number of orders to be

                    <li>
                      For a commander or operative to issue an order to a unit,
                      that unit must be eligible to receive that order. To be
                      eligible, a unit must meet all of the following

                  Each player creates an order pool that consists of all of

                      It is recommended that players place their order tokens in

                      To promote a commander, a player chooses any of their
                      trooper units or units with the field commander keyword on
                      the battlefield and places a commander token next to that
                      unit.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      When a player promotes a commander, they remove that
                      unit’s order token from the game and replace it with a
                      commander-rank order token.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      A unit promoted to commander is activated using a
                      commander-rank order token instead of the rank printed on
                      the unit’s card.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      A unit that has been promoted to commander does not retain
                      its previous rank. It is considered to be a commander for
                      all effects and game play purposes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      In the rare instance where a player no longer has a
                      trooper unit to promote, they no longer have a commander
                      and cannot play command cards.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      When a commander is defeated, their commanderspecific
                      command cards are not discarded from the player's command
                      hand, even though they can no longer be played.

                </li>
                <li>
                  If a unit is at range 1–3 of a friendly commander, it may use
                  that commander’s courage value instead of its own when
                  checking to see if it is panicked.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      A courage value of “–” is considered infinite when
                      checking whether a unit is panicked, including when a unit
                      is using a friendly commander’s courage value.

              <h4>Compulsory Move</h4>
              <p>
                Some game effects require a unit to perform a compulsory move at
                the start or end of the Perform Actions step of its activation.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A compulsory move is a free standard move action.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      A compulsory move triggers abilities that occur after move
                      actions are performed. However, as a free action, it does
                      not count against the unit’s two actions per activation.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  While performing a compulsory move, if a unit's maximum speed
                  is reduced, that unit is still considered to be performing a
                  move at its maximum speed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To perform a compulsory move, the unit performs a full move at
                  its maximum speed. If it cannot do so, or if a full move would
                  cause any part of the unit leader’s base to be outside the
                  battlefield, it can perform a partial move instead, ending its
                  movement as far along the movement template as possible. If
                  the unit performs a partial movement in this way, the unit
                  suffers a number of wounds equal to its maximum speed.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      As the unit leader moves along a movement tool, if at any
                      point the unit leader's base is outside of the
                      battlefield, the unit is defeated.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  The final position of a compulsory move can displace trooper
                  units.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When a unit performs a compulsory move, the bases of the minis
                  in the unit can partially overhang ledges, as long as each
                  mini is stable and is not precariously placed. If there is not
                  room to place a unit leader’s base on the surface that the
                  unit is moving onto, or if any mini’s base cannot be placed
                  legally and maintain cohesion, that unit cannot complete the
                  compulsory move.
                </li>
                <li>
                  During a compulsory move, if the unit leader would end its
                  movement on a piece of terrain it would normally ignore due to
                  the
                  <strong class="keyword-reference">speeder x</strong> keyword
                  or the repulsor vehicle unit type, it may shift backwards
                  along the movement tool by a distance no greater than half the
                  length of its base, so that its base is able to be placed
                  legally on the battlefield or terrain piece. It may not do so
                  if the terrain is not ignored by the
                  <strong class="keyword-reference">speeder x</strong> keyword
                  or the repulsor vehicle unit type and would cause the unit to
                  be unable to complete the compulsory move.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      A unit leader’s base may only be moved backwards along the
                      movement tool, it cannot be moved forward past the end of
                      the movement tool.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      A unit leader’s base cannot be moved back more than half
                      the diameter of the base.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      A unit leader must still move as far along the movement
                      tool as possible, it may move back only to allow its base
                      to be placed legally and in a stable position on the
                      battlefield or piece of terrain.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If the unit leader still cannot be legally placed on the
                      battlefield, it moves as far along the movement tool as
                      possible and takes damage equal to its speed for failing
                      to complete its compulsory move.

              <p>
                Some characters, both heroes and villains, think a couple steps
                ahead and have more than one plan to fall back on. While
                building a command hand, for each unit with the
                <strong class="keyword-reference">contingencies x</strong>
                keyword in a player’s army, that player sets aside up to x
                additional command cards as contingency cards, where x is equal
                to the combined
                <strong class="keyword-reference">contingencies x</strong> value
                on their units. These set-aside cards can have any number of
                pips but must follow all other command hand rules as if they
                were chosen for that player’s command hand.
              </p>
              <p>
                After a player reveals a command card, before any other effects
                are resolved, that player may discard it to reveal one of their
                setaside contingency cards instead. The revealed contingency
                card is then treated as a selected and revealed command card.
                The number of pips on the revealed contingency card
                <strong>must</strong> be equal to the number of pips on the
                discarded card.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Only command cards can be set aside as contingency cards.

                <li>
                  Contingency cards are chosen and set aside while building an
                  army.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Contingency cards are <strong>not</strong> considered to be in
                  a player’s command hand.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When choosing contingency cards, a player cannot choose a card
                  with the same name as another of their contingency cards or a
                  card in their command hand.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When choosing contingency cards, a player cannot choose a card
                  with a unit name in the upper right that does not match the
                  name of a unit in their army.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Contingency cards are set-aside facedown. Like a player’s
                  command hand, they are considered to be hidden information. A
                  player can look at their own contingency cards at any time.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A contingency card can be reveled only if it could legally be
                  played as a command card. If a player reveals a contingency
                  card that cannot legally be played as a command card, it is
                  discarded and that player does not play a command card for
                  that round.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If both players have set-aside contingency cards, the blue
                  player must decide whether or not to reveal a contingency card
                  before the red player decides whether to reveal a contingency
                  card.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If all friendly units with contingencies x are defeated, a
                  player cannot reveal or use their contingency cards.

                Some characters are faithful companions or subservient minions,
                and are almost never seen apart from another character. A

                and the mini that represents that character is always added to
                another character’s unit. That character’s card is a counterpart

                A counterpart mini cannot be fielded as its own unit; it is

                keyword. A counterpart and its corresponding unit combine to

              <p>
                Courage is an attribute presented on each trooper’s unit card.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A trooper unit’s courage is indicated by the value next to the
                  courage icon.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If a trooper unit ever has a number of suppression tokens
                  assigned to it that is equal to or greater than that unit's
                  courage value, that unit is suppressed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Immediately after the “Rally” step of a trooper unit’s
                  activation, if that unit is suppressed, it loses one of its
                  two actions for that activation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A unit cannot lose an action due to gaining suppression tokens
                  and becoming suppressed after it has already performed its
                  "Rally" step. Nor can a unit regain a lost action by removing
                  suppression tokens and no longer being suppressed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Immediately after the “Rally” step of a trooper unit’s
                  activation, if that unit has a number of suppression tokens
                  equal to or greater than twice its courage value, it panics.
                  During a panicked unit’s activation, it cannot perform free
                  actions and must use its entire activation to perform a single
                  move at its maximum speed as directly as possible toward the
                  nearest edge of the battlefield.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      If the unit leader ends this movement with any part of its
                      base outside of the battlefield, the unit is defeated.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If a unit is at range 1–3 of a friendly commander, it may
                      use that commander’s courage value instead of its own when
                      checking to see if it is panicked.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Some trooper units do not have a courage value. These units
                  have a “–” on their unit card where a courage value would
                  normally be.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      A trooper unit without a courage value cannot gain
                      suppression tokens. As such, that unit cannot become
                      suppressed or panicked.

              <h4>Cover</h4>
              <p>
                During a ranged attack, terrain that lies between two units can
                grant protection to the defender in the form of cover.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  There are two only types of cover: light cover and heavy
                  cover. Cover is usually granted by terrain.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Barricades provide heavy cover to non-creature trooper
                      units that they obscure.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Emplacement troopers provide light cover to units that
                      they obscure.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Creature troopers provide light cover to units that they
                      obscure.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Ground vehicles provide light or heavy cover to units that
                      they obscure. Walking or legged vehicles provide light
                      cover; wheeled or treaded vehicles provide heavy cover.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Minis in the same unit cannot obscure or provide cover to
                      one another.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Custom terrain can provide units with light or heavy
                      cover. Players should determine the cover type of all
                      custom terrain before the game begins.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  During the “Apply Dodge and Cover” step of a ranged attack, a
                  unit that has light cover can cancel one hit (<img

                  Various game effects, such as suppression tokens and the

                  improve a unit’s cover by one or more.

                    <li>
                      When a unit that does not have cover improves its cover by
                      one, it is treated as having light cover.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      When a unit that does not have cover improves its cover by
                      two or more, it is treated as having heavy cover.

                    <li>
                      When a unit that has light cover improves its cover by one
                      or more, it is treated as having heavy cover.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If a unit has heavy cover, that unit does not gain any
                      benefit from improving its cover.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  To determine if a unit has cover during an attack, a player
                  performs the following steps:
                </li>
              </ul>

                  >
                  The player checks line of sight from the attacker’s unit
                  leader to each mini in the defending unit. If any part of a
                  defending mini, including its base, is blocked by a piece of
                  terrain, the player then traces an imaginary line from the
                  center of the base of the attacker’s unit leader to the center
                  of the base of the defending mini. If the imaginary line
                  crosses the piece of terrain that blocked line of sight, the
                  defending mini is obscured. The player repeats this process
                  for each mini in the defender to determine how many of those
                  minis are obscured.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      If the attacking unit leader’s base is touching a piece of
                      terrain, that piece of terrain cannot cause a mini in the
                      defender to be obscured, unless line of sight from the
                      unit leader to that mini is completely blocked.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Ground vehicles, creature troopers, and emplacement
                      troopers can provide cover. When determining whether a
                      defending mini is obscured, treat any ground vehicle,
                      creature trooper, or emplacement trooper minis as if they
                      are pieces of area terrain.

                    <li>
                      If the attacking unit leader’s base is touching another
                      mini's base, that mini cannot cause a mini in the defender
                      to be obscured, unless line of sight from the unit leader
                      to the defending mini is completely blocked.

                    <li>
                      When determining whether a piece of terrain blocks line of
                      sight to a defending mini with a notched base, if there is
                      a clear peg separating the defending mini and its base,
                      the clear peg and the base are not treated as a part of
                      the mini.

                    <li>
                      When determining whether an imaginary line traced between
                      the centers of two minis' bases crosses a piece of
                      terrain, the line is always treated as horizontal to the
                      battlefield, on a two-dimensional plain. A player should
                      look down from above the battlefield to determine whether
                      the imaginary line crosses a piece of terrain.

                      the vehicle.

                      In the case that some of the obscured minis are obscured

                      obscured by an object that provides heavy cover, that unit

                      This is because when checking line of sight from the

              <p>
                A unit with the

                able to forgo their command position to infiltrate onto the
                battlefield as an independent operative. When a unit with the
                <strong class="keyword-reference">covert ops</strong> keyword
                deploys, it may treat its rank as operative instead of commander
                to gain the
                <strong class="keyword-reference">infiltrate</strong> keyword.

                  change its rank to operative, if there is not another unit
                  with the commander rank in that player’s army, that player
                  must immediately promote a unit with the rank of corps or
                  special forces to the rank of commander. Place a commander
                  token near that unit, and remove their order token from the
                  game, replacing it with a commander order token.

                    <li>
                      The promoted unit can be one that has already deployed or

                  change its rank to operative, its rank is treated as operative
                  for that entire game. Add an operative order token to the
                  order pool for that unit (instead of a commander order token).
                  Place an operative marker token near the unit on the

                    <li>
                      That unit is issued orders and activated with an operative

              <h4>Declaring Terrain</h4>
              <p>
                During setup, it is imperative to determine which effects each
                piece of terrain will have before the game begins. Players
                should briefly discuss each piece of terrain that will be on the
                battlefield and come to a consensus on its cover type and other
                characteristics.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Whether or not a piece of terrain will provide cover to a unit
                  usually depends on the size of that piece of terrain relative
                  to the minis in that unit. As a general rule, terrain that
                  blocks line of sight to half or more of a mini will provide
                  cover, while terrain that blocks less than half of a mini will
                  not. This means that trooper minis will frequently enjoy the
                  benefits of cover, while vehicles often will not.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Whether or not a piece of terrain will provide cover, and
                      if so to what units, should be determined
                      <strong>during</strong> setup.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Terrain either provides no cover, light cover, or heavy cover,
                  depending on its characteristics. Terrain that completely
                  blocks line of sight always provides heavy cover.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      The level of cover that a piece of terrain will provide,
                      and to what types of units, should be determined
                      <strong>during</strong> setup.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <!-- <li>Players should use the "Terrain Types" on page 8, as a
guide when determining terrain effects during setup. ADD THIS LATER</li> -->
                <li>
                  Once the level of cover that a piece of terrain will provide
                  has been determined during setup, that piece of terrain
                  provides that cover to the relevant units regardless of the
                  degree to which minis in those units are blocked by that
                  terrain.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Checking whether a piece of terrain is blocking half or
                      more, or less than half, of a mini is only used during
                      setup to determine whether or not that piece of terrain
                      will provide cover during the game.
                    </li>

                <li>
                  If a unit performs a move that causes any part of its unit
                  leader's base to be outside of the battlefield, including
                  while moving along a movement tool, that unit is defeated.

                  In the rare situation in which a unit leader is defeated and
                  there are still minis in that unit, the player who controls
                  that unit must immediately choose another mini in that unit to
                  become the unit leader—the player replaces the chosen mini
                  with the unit leader mini.

                      If a player’s unit leader with a claimed objective token

                      that player flips the objective token to its unclaimed

                      position and in base contact with the unit leader. The

              <h4>Defining the Battlefield</h4>
              <p>
                During setup, players define the battlefield by selecting
                objective, condition, and deployment cards. First, they shuffle
                the objective, deployment, and condition decks separately. Then,
                they draw and reveal three cards from each deck, placing the
                three cards from each deck in horizontal rows, called
                categories, facing the blue player’s long table edge. Then,
                starting with the blue player, each player takes turns choosing
                a category and eliminating the leftmost card in that category’s
                horizontal row until both players have had an opportunity to
                eliminate two cards. After each player has had two opportunities
                to eliminate a card, the leftmost card in each category’s row
                that was not eliminated is the card used to define the
                battlefield for the game.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A player may forfeit their opportunity to eliminate a card if
                  they wish to do so.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If players eliminate the first two cards in a category, the
                  final card cannot be eliminated.

                  improve or add to the benefits of the

                <li>
                  If the defender uses the

                  during an attack, it is possible for the attacker to be

                  inflicts a number of wounds that causes the attacker to be
                  defeated, the attack still continues and the defender can
                  still suffer wounds.

                </li>
                <li>
                  The measurements for each deployment zone are indicated as

                  deploys one of their units. Then, the red player chooses and
                  deploys one of their units. Players alternate deploying units

                game effect, perform a separate attack against each unit
                (regardless of which player owns that unit) that the token has
                line of sight to, using the area weapon, surge conversion chart,
                and weapon keywords on the card associated with the token that
                is being detonated.
              </p>
              <p>
                After a token detonates, remove that token from the battlefield.

                  />) indicates that a weapon is an area weapon. When a charge
                  or condition token detonates, use the area weapon on the card
                  associated with that token.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When using an area weapon, perform a separate attack against
                  each unit that is in line of sight and at the range indicated
                  by the number on the range icon, determined from the edge of
                  the charge or condition token that is detonating.

                <li>
                  When a token detonates, refer to the surge conversion chart
                  associated with that token, regardless of whether a unit
                  placed that token or used an ability to detonate it

                  When a token detonates, units cannot spend aim tokens to
                  modify attack dice, regardless of whether a unit placed that
                  token or used an ability to detonate it.

                  When a token detonates, if there are multiple defending units,
                  the player who controls the unit that used an ability to
                  detonate the token chooses the order of the attacks made by
                  the charge token.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If a token would detonate after a unit performs a move or any
                  action, that token detonates before any other abilities or
                  effects that occur after a unit moves or performs an action;
                  with the exception of spending a standby token which can be
                  spent by a unit before the token detonates.

                <li>
                  Ranged attacks made by area weapons are performed against each

                  engaged.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To determine line of sight from a token to a unit, determine
                  line of sight from the unit to the token instead. If any minis
                  in the unit have line of sight to the token, then the token
                  has line of sight to that unit and to those minis.

                <li>
                  When a token detonates, if there are multiple defending units,
                  the player who controls the unit that caused the token to
                  detonate chooses the order of the attacks made by the
                  condition token.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Each attack made when a token detonates is a ranged attack.

              <h4>Difficult Terrain</h4>
              <p>
                Difficult terrain is anything that impedes but does not
                completely block movement.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  While performing a standard move, a unit that begins its move
                  with any of its minis in difficult terrain has its maximum
                  speed reduced by 1, to a minimum of 1.
                </li>
                <li>
                  While performing a standard move, a unit that would move
                  through or enter difficult terrain with any of its minis has
                  its maximum speed reduced by 1, to a minimum of 1.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      A unit that moves into base contact with difficult terrain
                      but does not move through it or enter it does not suffer
                      this speed reduction.<br /><br /><em
                        >For example, a unit of Stormtroopers whose unit leader
                        moves into base contact with a barricade does not reduce
                        its speed.</em
                      >
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  The effect of difficult terrain is not cumulative with itself.
                  A unit cannot reduce its maximum speed below 1 by moving
                  though multiple pieces of difficult terrain. However, the
                  effect of difficult terrain can be combined with other effects
                  that reduce a unit’s maximum speed to cause a unit’s maximum
                  speed to be less than 1.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When an effect causes a unit to perform a speed-x move, that
                  move is not affected by difficult terrain.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Difficult terrain affects vehicles, including when performing
                  a reverse, strafe, or compulsory move.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A unit can pivot, climb, or clamber while in difficult terrain
                  without suffering any additional penalties.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When a unit performs a move, apply any effects that increase
                  the unit’s maximum speed (up to speed 3), before applying any
                  effects that reduce that unit’s maximum speed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Whether or not a piece of terrain is difficult depends on a
                  unit’s type (trooper, ground vehicle, or repulsor vehicle).

                    >For example, a barricade is difficult terrain for trooper
                    units, but not for vehicle units. Both ground and repulsor
                    vehicle units can move through barricades without incurring
                    any penalties.</em

                      When using custom terrain, it is important to define the
                      difficulty of that terrain as it relates to each unit type
                      prior to the beginning of the game.

                A unit with the

                always specifically states the unit name, rank, or type of this
                other unit. Each Command Phase, during the Issue Orders step, a
                unit with the

                issue an order to a friendly unit at range 1–2 that meets the

                  Game effects that trigger when a unit is issued an order, such
