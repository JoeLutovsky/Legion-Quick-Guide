              <h4>Abilities</h4>
              <p>
                Cards contain abilities that either grant passive effects to
                units or can be triggered for specific effects.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Abilities on unit cards are presented as keywords. The front
                  of each unit card provides reminder text for that unit’s unit
                  keywords. The back of each unit card provides reminder text
                  for that unit’s weapon keywords.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Reminder text is not an exhaustive description of the
                      rules for a keyword. If a player has questions about how a
                      keyword works, that player should refer to that keyword’s
                      glossary entry.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Upgrade cards and command cards also contain abilities in the
                  form of keywords.
                </li>
                <li>

                  />) icon, that ability can be performed as a card action as
                  one of the two actions that a unit can perform during its
                  activation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If an ability is preceded by a free card action (<img

                    alt="Free Action Symbol"
                  />) icon, that ability can be performed as a free card action
                  in addition to the two actions that a unit can perform during
                  its activation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Some cards must be exhausted as a cost to perform the ability
                  on the card. Such a card contains an exhaust (<img
                    class="game-icon"
                    src="img/legion-exhaust.png"

                    <li>
                      If a card that has an exhaust icon is already exhausted, a
                      player cannot resolve that card’s ability until the card
                      is readied.

                    <li>
                      A unit can ready any number of its exhausted cards by
                      performing a recover action.

                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the timing of an ability uses the word “after,” that
                  ability’s effect occurs immediately after the described timing
                  event has occurred.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the timing of an ability uses the word “when,” that
                  ability’s effect occurs at the exact moment of the described
                  timing event.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the timing of an ability uses the word “while,” that
                  ability’s effect occurs during a specific step of the
                  described timing event.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If an ability allows a unit to trigger an effect after it
                  moves, the ability can be triggered after any type of move,
                  but not after the unit withdraws, unless that unit is a
                  creature or emplacement trooper.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If an effect provides a unit with either a move or an attack
                  that is not an action or free action, performing that move or
                  attack does not trigger abilities that occur after move or
                  attack actions are performed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If an effect allows a unit to gain an aim, dodge, or standby
                  token, that effect is different than performing an aim, dodge,
                  or standby action and does not trigger abilities that occur
                  after those actions are performed.
                </li>

                      Each card action is a unique action; a unit can perform
                      different card actions during its activation. However, a

                  If an effect provides a unit with a free action without
                  specifying a type of action, that unit may perform any action
                  that it could normally perform. Performing that free action
                  does not count against that unit’s two actions per activation,
                  but is considered an action for the purposes of game effects

                  multiple attacks through the use of command cards or other
                  abilities. If an effect provides a unit with an attack during
                  its activation, and that attack is not an action or free
                  action, performing that attack does not count toward a unit’s
                  limit of a single attack action per activation. It is not an
                  action and therefore does not count against that unit’s two
                  actions per activation and does not trigger abilities that
                  occur after actions are performed.

                  Card effects can allow units to gain aim, dodge, and standby
                  tokens. If an effect specifically instructs a unit to gain an
                  aim, dodge, or standby token, that effect is different than
                  performing an aim, dodge, or standby action and therefore does

              <p>
                During the Activation Phase, players take turns activating their
                units.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  When a unit activates, that unit can perform up to two
                  actions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The steps of unit activation are as follows:
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Start of Unit Activation:</strong>
                      If there is an effect that triggers “when” a unit
                      activates or “at the start” of its activation, that effect
                      triggers during this step.
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          If more than one effect takes place at the start of a
                          unit’s activation, the player that controls that unit
                          decides the order of these effects.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          At the start of a vehicle unit’s activation, if that
                          unit is damaged, it must roll a white defense die. If
                          this roll produces a blank result, it can perform only
                          one action, instead of two
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Rally:</strong> If the unit has one or more
                      suppression tokens, it rolls one white defense die for
                      each suppression token it has. For each block (<img
                        class="game-icon"

                        alt="Block Symbol"
                      />) or defense surge (<img

                        src="img/legion-defense-surge.png"
                        alt="Free Action Symbol"
                      />) result the roll produces, the unit removes one of its
                      suppression tokens
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Perform Actions:</strong>
                      A unit that is not suppressed can perform up to two
                      actions and any number of free actions. A unit that is
                      suppressed or that has lost an action due to being damaged
                      can perform only one action and any number of free
                      actions.
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          A droid trooper or vehicle unit also loses one action
                          for each ion token that unit has when it activates.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          After a player activates a unit, that player places
                          its order token facedown (rank side down) on the
                          battlefield near the unit leader.
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>End of Unit Activation:</strong>
                      If there is an effect that triggers “at the end” of a
                      unit's activation, that effect triggers during this step.
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          If more than one effect takes place at the end of a
                          unit’s activation, the player that controls that unit
                          decides the order of these effects.

                  continue alternating turns until each unit on the battlefield
                  has activated.

                      If one player has more units on the battlefield than the

                      activates their last unit, the player who has more units

                  <strong class="keyword-reference">Choose Unit:</strong> The
                  player either chooses a friendly unit with a faceup order
                  token or draws a random order token from their order pool and
                  chooses a friendly unit with a matching rank that does not

                  activated—usually because that unit was defeated and removed
                  from the battlefield—the player removes the order token from
                  the game and draws a different token from their order pool.

                  A unit can reroll the same die multiple times by spending

                it gains 1 dodge token. After it defends, it gains 1 aim token.
                While defending against a ranged attack, if it spends a dodge
                token, the attacker suffers 1 wound for each

              <h4>Attack</h4>
              <p>Units can perform attacks to attempt to defeat enemy units.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A unit typically performs an attack by performing an attack
                  action during its activation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  During a unit’s activation, it is possible for a unit to
                  perform more than one attack through the use of card abilities
                  or other game effects; however, that unit can only perform one
                  attack action during a single activation, regardless of
                  whether it is an attack action or a free attack action.
                </li>
                <li>
                  During an attack, the unit that is performing the attack is
                  the attacker and the target of the attack is the defender.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Multiple units can be chosen as defenders (see step 3).

                </li>
                <li>
                  There are two types of attacks: ranged and melee.

                    <li>
                      During a ranged attack, the attacker and defender are not
                      in a melee, and the attacker can use only weapons that
                      have a blue range (<img

                      During a melee attack, the attacker and defender are in a
                      melee, and the attacker can use only weapons that have a
                      red melee (<img

                  Command cards, unit abilities, and other game effects can
                  allow units to perform attacks. The card granting the attack
                  will specify whether the attack is an attack action, a free
                  attack action, or neither.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To perform an attack, a player resolves the following steps:
                </li>
              </ul>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Declare Defender:</strong>
                  The attacking player chooses one enemy unit to attack; this
                  enemy unit is now the defender. Then, the attacking player
                  measures the range from the attacker’s unit leader to the
                  closest miniature of the defender to determine the attack’s
                  range.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Form Attack Pool:</strong>
                  The attack pool consists of all the dice the attacker will
                  roll against this defender. When forming the attack pool,
                  players follow these substeps in order:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <em>Determine Eligible Minis:</em>
                      Each mini in the attacker is eligible to contribute to the
                      attack pool if that mini has line of sight to any mini in
                      the defender.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <em>Choose Weapons:</em> The attacker can choose one
                      weapon from each eligible mini to contribute to the attack
                      pool. To choose a weapon, the attacker must meet all
                      requirements indicated by that weapon’s keywords, and that
                      weapon’s range must include the range of the attack, as
                      determined from the attacker’s unit leader to the closest
                      mini of the defender.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <em>Gather Dice:</em> For each eligible mini that chose a
                      weapon, the attacker gathers the number and type of dice
                      depicted on that weapon and places them on the battlefield
                      near the defender.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Declare Additional Defender:</strong>
                  If there are any weapons remaining that have not been added to
                  the attack pool, the player may repeat steps 1–2, forming a
                  separate attack pool with the new weapons.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Each eligible mini can contribute a weapon to only one
                      attack pool, unless it has the
                      <strong class="keyword-reference">arsenal x</strong>
                      keyword and can use more than one weapon during an attack.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      An attack pool can consist of dice from different weapons,
                      but all weapons with an identical name must contribute
                      their dice to the same attack pool.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The dice in each attack pool should be placed near the
                      corresponding defender.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  <strong>Roll Attack Dice:</strong>
                  The attacker chooses an attack pool and resolves the following
                  substeps in order:

                    <li>

                      <em>Reroll Dice:</em> The attacker can resolve any
                      abilities that allow the attacker to reroll attack dice.

                      turning the die. If no result is indicated, the attacker
                      changes the result to a blank.

              <h4>Attack Pool</h4>
              <p>
                An attack pool is a number of dice generated from weapons that
                are being used against a single target during an attack.
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Each weapon that is used during an attack contributes one or
                  more dice to an attack pool.
                </li>
                <li>
                  During an attack, the attacker can create multiple attack
                  pools to attack multiple defenders. However, only one attack
                  pool can be assigned to each defender.
                </li>
                <li>
                  An attack pool can consist of dice from different weapons, but
                  all weapons with an identical name must contribute their dice
                  to the same attack pool.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A weapon can only contribute its dice to an attack pool if the
                  following restrictions are met:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      The range of the attack is equal to or greater than the
                      weapons’ minimum range and equal to or less than the
                      weapon’s maximum range.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The miniature using the weapon has line of sight to at
                      least one mini in the defending unit.
                    </li>
                    <li>If the weapon can exhaust, it must be readied.</li>
                    <li>

                      keyword to the attack pool, the defender must be inside
                      the specified firing arc of the attacking mini.

                  Each weapon that contributes dice to an attack pool also
                  applies its keywords to that attack pool.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      If a weapon has a keyword that allows a player to modify
                      one or more dice in the attack pool, the player can use
                      that effect to modify any dice in the attack pool, not
                      just the dice that this weapon contributed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If a weapon has a keyword that changes how the results of
                      the attack roll affects the defender, the entire attack
                      roll affects the defender in that way, not just dice that
                      the weapon that has that keyword contributed.<br /><br />

                  The barricades in the core set provide non-creature troopers

                <li>
                  Typically, barricades do not provide vehicles with cover.

                      A barricade is difficult terrain for most trooper units;

              <ul>

                <li>
                  Creature and emplacement trooper minis are affixed to notched

                <li>
                  The orientation of a mini affixed to a small round base has no
                  gameplay implications. A player can freely rotate a mini
                  affixed to such a base during its movement.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A mini affixed to a notched base cannot be rotated freely;
                  during its movement, it must either pivot or move along the
                  movement tool, keeping the notches in the base aligned with
                  the movement tool.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The space created by the notch in a mini's base should be
                  treated as a part of that mini's base by other minis.
                  Therefore, no mini’s base may be placed inside the notches of
                  another mini’s base.

              <h4>Base Contact</h4>
              <p>
                Base contact refers to a miniature’s base physically touching
                something on the battlefield, typically a piece of terrain,
                another mini, or an objective token.
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  If the bases of two minis are touching each other, those minis
                  are in base contact.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If a mini’s base is touching a piece of terrain or an
                  objective token, that mini is in base contact with that
                  terrain or token.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Friendly minis from different units can be in base contact
                  with each other.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Minis cannot be in base contact with minis from enemy units,
                  unless the unit leader has a melee weapon (<img
                    class="game-icon"
                    src="img/legion-melee.png"
                    alt="Melee Symbol"
                  />), in which case the unit leader can perform a move into
                  base contact with a mini from an enemy unit to start a melee.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Because a mini’s base can overhang a ledge or be placed askew
                  on top of uneven terrain, there are sometimes situations in
                  which an another mini cannot be placed into physical base
                  contact with the first mini because of a slight difference in
                  elevation between the two bases. In these situations, if two
                  conditions are met, those minis are treated as if they are in
                  base contact. These conditions are as follows:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      First, when viewed from above, there is no space between
                      the two minis bases, such that if they were not on
                      differing elevations or they were both flat on the
                      battlefield, their bases would be touching.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Second, the vertical space separating the two bases is
                      less than the thickness of a standard
                      <em>STAR WARS: LEGION</em> base.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If these two conditions are met, minis in this situation
                      are considered to be in base contact and follow all the
                      normal rules for being in base contact.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  If a player is attempting to move a mini into base contact
                  with another mini and those minis are blocked from being
                  placed in base contact by the non-base portion of either mini,
                  the payer that is moving the mini may alter that mini’s final
                  position, within an acceptable margin, such that the minis are
                  placed in base contact.
                  <!--For further rules, see
                  "Margin of Error" on page 11-->

                <li>
                  Units cannot be placed into or move into base contact with an

                to a 50mm notched base with 1 to 2 bombs, or similarly sized
                minis, placed on top of the pallet. When playing a game with the
                Payload objective card, each player may supply their own bomb
                cart. Or, if one player has supplied both bomb carts, the other
                player should choose which of the two bomb carts is theirs to
                use for that game.

              <p>
                Each piece of terrain chosen while resolving the Payload

                  A bomb cart mini provides heavy cover to non-creature

                  A bomb cart mini can move through all units, friendly and

                  another mini that cannot be displaced.

                    <li>
                      A bomb cart mini can move through a group of friendly and

                  A bomb cart mini can move through or over impassible terrain,

                chooses an enemy commander or enemy operative and marks that
                unit with a victory token. Place that token on the enemy unit's
                unit card.
              </p>
              <p>
                After a unit with the
                <strong class="keyword-reference">bounty</strong> keyword
                defeats an enemy unit with a victory token (typically by
                performing an attack against that unit which causes it to be
                defeated), the victory token moves to the unit with
                <strong class="keyword-reference">bounty</strong>. Place that
                token on its unit card.

                At the end of the game, if a player controls a unit that has the

                has at least 1 victory token due to defeating an enemy unit, and
                that unit has not been defeated itself, that player gains 1
                victory token. A player gains 1 victory token in this way for
                each unit they control that meets these requirements.

                keyword can choose a friendly trooper unit at range 1 and in

                A card action is a type of action. If an ability is preceded by

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Each card action is a unique action; a unit can perform
                  different card actions during its activation. However, a unit
                  cannot perform the same card action more than once during its
                  activation.
                </li>

                  If a card action provides a unit with either a move or an
                  attack that is <strong>not</strong> treated as a move action
                  or an attack action, performing that move or attack is
                  different than performing a move action or attack action, even
                  though the result is the same.

                <li>
                  Some card actions are treated as other types of actions, such
                  as a move action or an attack action. This is indicated in the
                  text of the card action itself. When a unit performs that card
                  action, treat that action as the type of action indicated in
                  its text, as well as a card action, for the purposes of all
                  gameplay effects and abilities, including triggering other
                  abilities that occur after the indicated action.<br /><br />

                    For example, after performing a move, if Darth Vader is
                    equipped with the Saber Throw upgrade card, he can use the
                    relentless ability to perform a ranged attack using the

                  tokens. If a card action specifically instructs a unit to gain
                  an aim, dodge, or standby token, that effect is different than
                  performing an aim, dodge, or standby action and therefore does
                  not trigger abilities that occur after aim, dodge, or standby
                  actions are performed.

                      To clamber over a vertical piece of terrain without a flat

                  When measuring cohesion between two minis that are placed on

                  measuring from a view above the battlefield as if the two

                      within the distance of a legal climb move. If a unit

                      unit that are below their unit leader must be in base
                      contact with that terrain such that moving between the
                      position of the leader and the position of any mini in the

                          must be height 1 or lower.

                      clambered, or lower than the level to which the unit

                  A unit does not have to climb or clamber to move up a gradual
                  slope such as a hill. As a general rule, if a miniature can be
                  placed on a slope without falling over, units can move up that
                  slope by performing a standard move. Players should clearly

                  stable and is not precariously placed. If there is not room to
                  place a unit leader’s base on the surface that the unit is
                  climbing or clambering onto, or if any mini’s base cannot be
                  placed legally and maintain cohesion, that unit cannot perform

              <p>
                Each non-leader miniature in a unit must be in cohesion with its

                <li>
                  After a unit leader moves, is deployed to the battlefield, or
                  is displaced on the battlefield, each other mini in that unit
                  must be placed in cohesion with that unit leader.

                <li>
                  A mini is in cohesion with its unit leader if the distance

                  the length of the speed-1 movement tool.

                      If the base of a unit leader is touching one end of the
                      speed-1 movement tool, and the base of a different mini in
                      that unit is touching the other end of the speed-1
                      movement tool, those minis are at the maximum distance of

                  When moving a unit leader, a player can push aside any minis
                  from that unit to make it easier to place the movement tool on
                  the battlefield.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If moving multiple units at the same time because of
                  displacement, a player can move the unit leaders from those
                  units first, and then place the remaining minis in cohesion
                  with their respective leaders.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When placing minis in cohesion, the bases of the minis in the
                  unit can partially overhang ledges, as long as the mini is

                  When placing a mini in cohesion with its unit leader, that
                  mini must be placed such that the distance between the mini
                  and its unit leader could be made as a legal speed-1 move from
                  the final position of the unit leader.

                    <li>
                      This means that when placing a mini in cohesion with its
                      unit leader it cannot be placed on the other side of
                      impassable terrain from its unit leader.

                      However, minis being placed in cohesion are considered to
                      be able to move through any enemy trooper minis with which
                      they are engaged.

                      Notched-based minis must obey this rule; however, the
                      speed-1 move between the mini’s position and the unit
                      leader’s position is determined as if both the mini and
                      the unit leader can pivot up to 180&#176; before and after
                      the move is measured.<br /><br /><em

                        is a piece of blocking terrain between the mini and its

                        the position of the unit leader, then cohesion is
                        maintained, but if there is not a legal speed-1 move
                        between the position of the mini and the position of the

                  any minis in that unit that are below their unit leader must

                      In order for the distance between a mini’s position and

                      After climbing or clambering, the unit leader will by

                      with which it was in base contact before climbing or
                      clambering. Minis not placed on the same edge of the

                <li>
                  There are four command cards available to all commanders:
                  “Ambush,” “Push,” “Assault,” and “Standing Orders.”
                </li>
                <li>
                  Each commander and operative has at least three command cards
                  specific to that character that can only be used if that
                  character is included in that army.

                    <li>
                      Character-specific command cards are identified by the
                      name of that character appearing below the name of the
                      command card.

                    <li>
                      If a player's character has access to more than three
                      character-specific command cards, that player can include
                      any number of those cards in their command hand, so long
                      as they follow all command hand rules.

                <li>
                  Each command card has a number of pips in the upper-left
                  corner of the card. These are used to determine which player
                  has priority each round.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Each command card indicates the number and type of units that
                  can be issued orders, or it indicates the name or names of
                  specific units that can be issued orders.

                <li>
                  Any units indicated on a command card can be issued orders
                  only if they are at range 1–3 of the nominated unit. A
                  nominated unit is at range 1 of itself.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A player must issue orders to as many units indicated on a
                  command card as possible.

                <li>
                  Some command cards have unique effects when they are played.

                      If no specific timing is provided, the effect is resolved
                      after command cards have been revealed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If both players play a command card with a unique card
                      effect that does not have a specific timing, the blue
                      player resolves the game effect on their command card
                      first.

                    <li>
                      If a player plays a command card with a unique card effect
                      that is resolved when that card is revealed, that game
                      effect is resolved before any command card game effects
                      without a specific timing.<br /><br /><em

                      When a player returns a command card to their command hand

                  Some command cards contain weapon profiles. Typically there
                  are two ways these weapon profiles can be used: a unit
                  specified by the command card gains the weapon on the card and
                  can use it during its activation, or a unit specified by the
                  command card may perform an attack using the weapon on the
                  card at the end of its activation.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      If a unit gains a weapon from a command card, that weapon
                      is treated as though it is on the unit's unit card.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If a unit may perform an attack with a weapon on a command
                      card, it cannot use the
                      <strong class="keyword-reference">arsenal x</strong>
                      keyword to add additional weapons to the attack pool; the
                      attack must be made only with the weapon on the command
                      card. This does not apply to a weapon that a unit gains
                      via a command card, as that weapon is considered to be on
                      its unit card.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If a unit may perform an attack with a weapon on a command
                      card, it must be able to perform an attack of the type
                      specified by the range icon of the weapon. An engaged
                      trooper unit cannot perform ranged attacks, unless the
                      weapon has the
                      <strong class="keyword-reference">versatile</strong>
                      keyword.

                    <li>
                      If a unit gains a weapon from a command card, a
                      counterpart that is a part of that unit does not gain that
                      weapon, unless otherwise stated by a card effect.

              <h4>Command Phase</h4>
              <p>
                During the Command Phase, each player selects a command card
                from their hand and chooses a commander to issue orders to one
                or more units on the battlefield.<br /><br />
                To resolve the Command Phase, players perform the following
                steps in order:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Select Command Card:</strong>
                  Each player secretly selects a command card from their hand
                  and places it facedown on the table. Then, both players
                  simultaneously reveal their cards.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      If a player does not have a commander or an operative on
                      the battlefield, they do not select or resolve a command
                      card.
                    </li>
                    <li>A player must select a command card if able.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Determine Priority:</strong>
                  The player whose card has the fewest number of pips has
                  priority.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      If both cards have the same number of pips, the player who
                      has the round counter rolls a red defense die (six-sided
                      red die). If the result of the roll is a block (<img
                        src="img/legion-block.png"
                        alt="Block Symbol"
                        class="game-icon"
                      />), that player has priority. Otherwise, their opponent
                      has priority.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If one player plays a command card and their opponent does
                      not, the player who played a card has priority.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Issue Orders:</strong>
                  Starting with the player who has priority, each player
                  nominates a friendly eligible commander or operative and
                  issues orders with that unit. The number of orders to be
                  issued is indicated on the orders section of the chosen
                  command card.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      If a commander-specific or operative-specific command card
                      is played, the player must nominate that commander or
                      operative.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If a non-operative-specific command card is played, the
                      player cannot nominate an operative to issue orders.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      For a commander or operative to issue an order to a unit,
                      that unit must be eligible to receive that order. To be
                      eligible, a unit must meet all of the following
                      requirements:
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          The unit cannot have already received an order during
                          the current Command Phase.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          The unit must be at range 1–3 of the nominated
                          commander or operative.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          If a unit type (e.g., trooper) is specified on the
                          chosen command card, the unit being issued an order
                          must be of the specified type.
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                <li>
                  <strong>Create Order Pool:</strong>
                  Each player creates an order pool that consists of all of
                  their order tokens that they did not place on the battlefield
                  while resolving their command card.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      It is recommended that players place their order tokens in
                      an opaque bag; however, players can also create their
                      order pool by placing each order token facedown near the
                      battlefield and then shuffling those tokens.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  After players resolve these four steps, play proceeds to the
                  Activation Phase.

                are powerful heroes and villains that can issue orders to other

                      To promote a commander, a player chooses any of their
                      trooper units or units with the field commander keyword on

                      the unit’s card.

                    <li>
                      A unit that has been promoted to commander does not retain
                      its previous rank. It is considered to be a commander for
                      all effects and game play purposes.

                    <li>
                      In the rare instance where a player no longer has a
                      trooper unit to promote, they no longer have a commander
                      and cannot play command cards.

                    <li>
                      When a commander is defeated, their commanderspecific

                      A courage value of “–” is considered infinite when

                performs its “Rally” step, if that trooper unit is suppressed

              <h4>Compulsory Move</h4>
              <p>
                Some game effects require a unit to perform a compulsory move at
                the start or end of the Perform Actions step of its activation.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A compulsory move is a free standard move action.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      A compulsory move triggers abilities that occur after move
                      actions are performed. However, as a free action, it does
                      not count against the unit’s two actions per activation.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  While performing a compulsory move, if a unit's maximum speed
                  is reduced, that unit is still considered to be performing a
                  move at its maximum speed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To perform a compulsory move, the unit performs a full move at
                  its maximum speed. If it cannot do so, or if a full move would
                  cause any part of the unit leader’s base to be outside the
                  battlefield, it can perform a partial move instead, ending its
                  movement as far along the movement template as possible. If
                  the unit performs a partial movement in this way, the unit
                  suffers a number of wounds equal to its maximum speed.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      As the unit leader moves along a movement tool, if at any
                      point the unit leader's base is outside of the
                      battlefield, the unit is defeated.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  The final position of a compulsory move can displace trooper
                  units.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When a unit performs a compulsory move, the bases of the minis
                  in the unit can partially overhang ledges, as long as each
                  mini is stable and is not precariously placed. If there is not
                  room to place a unit leader’s base on the surface that the
                  unit is moving onto, or if any mini’s base cannot be placed
                  legally and maintain cohesion, that unit cannot complete the
                  compulsory move.
                </li>
                <li>
                  During a compulsory move, if the unit leader would end its
                  movement on a piece of terrain it would normally ignore due to
                  the
                  <strong class="keyword-reference">speeder x</strong> keyword
                  or the repulsor vehicle unit type, it may shift backwards
                  along the movement tool by a distance no greater than half the
                  length of its base, so that its base is able to be placed
                  legally on the battlefield or terrain piece. It may not do so
                  if the terrain is not ignored by the
                  <strong class="keyword-reference">speeder x</strong> keyword
                  or the repulsor vehicle unit type and would cause the unit to
                  be unable to complete the compulsory move.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      A unit leader’s base may only be moved backwards along the
                      movement tool, it cannot be moved forward past the end of
                      the movement tool.

                    <li>
                      A unit leader’s base cannot be moved back more than half
                      the diameter of the base.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      A unit leader must still move as far along the movement
                      tool as possible, it may move back only to allow its base
                      to be placed legally and in a stable position on the
                      battlefield or piece of terrain.

                    <li>
                      If the unit leader still cannot be legally placed on the
                      battlefield, it moves as far along the movement tool as
                      possible and takes damage equal to its speed for failing
                      to complete its compulsory move.

                Some characters, both heroes and villains, think a couple steps
                ahead and have more than one plan to fall back on. While
                building a command hand, for each unit with the
                <strong class="keyword-reference">contingencies x</strong>
                keyword in a player’s army, that player sets aside up to x
                additional command cards as contingency cards, where x is equal
                to the combined
                <strong class="keyword-reference">contingencies x</strong> value
                on their units. These set-aside cards can have any number of
                pips but must follow all other command hand rules as if they
                were chosen for that player’s command hand.
              </p>
              <p>
                After a player reveals a command card, before any other effects
                are resolved, that player may discard it to reveal one of their
                setaside contingency cards instead. The revealed contingency
                card is then treated as a selected and revealed command card.
                The number of pips on the revealed contingency card
                <strong>must</strong> be equal to the number of pips on the
                discarded card.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>

                <li>
                  When choosing contingency cards, a player cannot choose a card
                  with the same name as another of their contingency cards or a
                  card in their command hand.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When choosing contingency cards, a player cannot choose a card
                  with a unit name in the upper right that does not match the
                  name of a unit in their army.

                <li>
                  Contingency cards are set-aside facedown. Like a player’s
                  command hand, they are considered to be hidden information. A
                  player can look at their own contingency cards at any time.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A contingency card can be reveled only if it could legally be
                  played as a command card. If a player reveals a contingency
                  card that cannot legally be played as a command card, it is
                  discarded and that player does not play a command card for
                  that round.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If both players have set-aside contingency cards, the blue
                  player must decide whether or not to reveal a contingency card
                  before the red player decides whether to reveal a contingency
                  card.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If all friendly units with contingencies x are defeated, a

              <ul>
                <li>
                  A trooper unit’s courage is indicated by the value next to the

                <li>
                  If a trooper unit ever has a number of suppression tokens

                  Immediately after the “Rally” step of a trooper unit’s

                  During a panicked unit’s activation, it cannot perform free
                  actions and must use its entire activation to perform a single

                    <li>
                      If a unit is at range 1–3 of a friendly commander, it may

                  Some trooper units do not have a courage value. These units

              <h4>Cover</h4>
              <p>
                During a ranged attack, terrain that lies between two units can
                grant protection to the defender in the form of cover.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  There are two only types of cover: light cover and heavy
                  cover. Cover is usually granted by terrain.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Barricades provide heavy cover to non-creature trooper
                      units that they obscure.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Emplacement troopers provide light cover to units that
                      they obscure.

                    <li>
                      Creature troopers provide light cover to units that they

                    <li>
                      Ground vehicles provide light or heavy cover to units that
                      they obscure. Walking or legged vehicles provide light
                      cover; wheeled or treaded vehicles provide heavy cover.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Minis in the same unit cannot obscure or provide cover to
                      one another.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Custom terrain can provide units with light or heavy
                      cover. Players should determine the cover type of all
                      custom terrain before the game begins.

                <li>
                  During the “Apply Dodge and Cover” step of a ranged attack, a
                  unit that has light cover can cancel one hit (<img

                  Various game effects, such as suppression tokens and the

                      When a unit that does not have cover improves its cover by

                    <li>
                      When a unit that does not have cover improves its cover by

                    <li>
                      When a unit that has light cover improves its cover by one
                      or more, it is treated as having heavy cover.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If a unit has heavy cover, that unit does not gain any
                      benefit from improving its cover.

                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  To determine if a unit has cover during an attack, a player
                  performs the following steps:
                </li>
              </ul>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Determine Number of Obscured Miniatures:</strong>
                  The player checks line of sight from the attacker’s unit
                  leader to each mini in the defending unit. If any part of a
                  defending mini, including its base, is blocked by a piece of
                  terrain, the player then traces an imaginary line from the
                  center of the base of the attacker’s unit leader to the center
                  of the base of the defending mini. If the imaginary line
                  crosses the piece of terrain that blocked line of sight, the
                  defending mini is obscured. The player repeats this process
                  for each mini in the defender to determine how many of those
                  minis are obscured.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      If the attacking unit leader’s base is touching a piece of
                      terrain, that piece of terrain cannot cause a mini in the
                      defender to be obscured, unless line of sight from the
                      unit leader to that mini is completely blocked.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Ground vehicles, creature troopers, and emplacement
                      troopers can provide cover. When determining whether a
                      defending mini is obscured, treat any ground vehicle,
                      creature trooper, or emplacement trooper minis as if they
                      are pieces of area terrain.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If the attacking unit leader’s base is touching another
                      mini's base, that mini cannot cause a mini in the defender
                      to be obscured, unless line of sight from the unit leader
                      to the defending mini is completely blocked.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      When determining whether a piece of terrain blocks line of
                      sight to a defending mini with a notched base, if there is
                      a clear peg separating the defending mini and its base,
                      the clear peg and the base are not treated as a part of
                      the mini.

                    <li>
                      When determining whether an imaginary line traced between
                      the centers of two minis' bases crosses a piece of
                      terrain, the line is always treated as horizontal to the
                      battlefield, on a two-dimensional plain. A player should
                      look down from above the battlefield to determine whether
                      the imaginary line crosses a piece of terrain.

                  the defender’s minis are obscured, that unit has cover. The
                  type of cover that unit has is determined by the object that
                  is obscuring the minis, as follows:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      If the obscured minis are obscured by a ground vehicle,
                      that unit has either light or heavy cover, depending on
                      the vehicle.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If the obscured minis are obscured by a creature trooper
                      or emplacement trooper, that unit has light cover.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If the obscured minis are obscured by a barricade, and the
                      defender is a non-creature trooper unit, that unit has
                      heavy cover.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If the obscured minis are obscured by custom terrain, that
                      unit has the cover that the custom terrain provides.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      In the case that some of the obscured minis are obscured
                      by an object that provides light cover and some are
                      obscured by an object that provides heavy cover, that unit
                      has heavy cover, unless there are more minis that are
                      obscured by an object that provides light cover, in which
                      case the unit has light cover.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If an individual mini is obscured by both an object that
                      provides light cover and an object that provides heavy
                      cover, treat that mini as obscured by heavy cover.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      A defending unit on a piece of terrain with a higher
                      elevation than the attacking unit will usually have cover.
                      This is because when checking line of sight from the
                      attacking unit leader, a part of each defending minis'
                      base will most likely be obscured by the terrain that the
                      mini is on top of.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  with the commander rank in that player’s army, that player
                  must immediately promote a unit with the rank of corps or
                  special forces to the rank of commander. Place a commander
                  token near that unit, and remove their order token from the
                  game, replacing it with a commander order token.

              <p>
                During setup, it is imperative to determine which effects each
                piece of terrain will have before the game begins. Players
                should briefly discuss each piece of terrain that will be on the
                battlefield and come to a consensus on its cover type and other
                characteristics.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Whether or not a piece of terrain will provide cover to a unit
                  usually depends on the size of that piece of terrain relative
                  to the minis in that unit. As a general rule, terrain that
                  blocks line of sight to half or more of a mini will provide
                  cover, while terrain that blocks less than half of a mini will
                  not. This means that trooper minis will frequently enjoy the
                  benefits of cover, while vehicles often will not.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Whether or not a piece of terrain will provide cover, and
                      if so to what units, should be determined
                      <strong>during</strong> setup.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Terrain either provides no cover, light cover, or heavy cover,
                  depending on its characteristics. Terrain that completely
                  blocks line of sight always provides heavy cover.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      The level of cover that a piece of terrain will provide,

                When a miniature is defeated, it is removed from the battlefield
                and cannot be used for the remainder of the game.

                <li>
                  If a unit performs a move that causes any part of its unit
                  leader's base to be outside of the battlefield, including
                  while moving along a movement tool, that unit is defeated.

                  In the rare situation in which a unit leader is defeated and
                  there are still minis in that unit, the player who controls

                  become the unit leader—the player replaces the chosen mini

                      is defeated, before they remove or move the unit leader,
                      that player flips the objective token to its unclaimed
                      side and places it back onto the battlefield in the same
                      position and in base contact with the unit leader. The
                      objective token remains on the battlefield where it was
                      placed and can be claimed again as normal.

              <h4>Defining the Battlefield</h4>
              <p>
                During setup, players define the battlefield by selecting
                objective, condition, and deployment cards. First, they shuffle
                the objective, deployment, and condition decks separately. Then,
                they draw and reveal three cards from each deck, placing the
                three cards from each deck in horizontal rows, called
                categories, facing the blue player’s long table edge. Then,
                starting with the blue player, each player takes turns choosing
                a category and eliminating the leftmost card in that category’s
                horizontal row until both players have had an opportunity to
                eliminate two cards. After each player has had two opportunities
                to eliminate a card, the leftmost card in each category’s row
                that was not eliminated is the card used to define the
                battlefield for the game.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A player may forfeit their opportunity to eliminate a card if
                  they wish to do so.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If players eliminate the first two cards in a category, the
                  final card cannot be eliminated.

                  After a unit attacks, moves, or performs an action a charge

                  that occur after a unit performs an action; with the exception
                  of spending a standby token which can be spent by a unit

              <h4>Dice</h4>
              <p>
                Dice are used to resolve attacks, remove suppression, determine
                vehicle damage, and determine trooper damage while climbing or
                clambering.

              <h4>Difficult Terrain</h4>
              <p>
                Difficult terrain is anything that impedes but does not
                completely block movement.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  While performing a standard move, a unit that begins its move
                  with any of its minis in difficult terrain has its maximum
                  speed reduced by 1, to a minimum of 1.
                </li>
                <li>
                  While performing a standard move, a unit that would move
                  through or enter difficult terrain with any of its minis has
                  its maximum speed reduced by 1, to a minimum of 1.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      A unit that moves into base contact with difficult terrain
                      but does not move through it or enter it does not suffer
                      this speed reduction.<br /><br /><em
                        >For example, a unit of Stormtroopers whose unit leader
                        moves into base contact with a barricade does not reduce
                        its speed.</em
                      >
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  The effect of difficult terrain is not cumulative with itself.
                  A unit cannot reduce its maximum speed below 1 by moving
                  though multiple pieces of difficult terrain. However, the
                  effect of difficult terrain can be combined with other effects
                  that reduce a unit’s maximum speed to cause a unit’s maximum
                  speed to be less than 1.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When an effect causes a unit to perform a speed-x move, that
                  move is not affected by difficult terrain.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Difficult terrain affects vehicles, including when performing
                  a reverse, strafe, or compulsory move.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A unit can pivot, climb, or clamber while in difficult terrain
                  without suffering any additional penalties.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When a unit performs a move, apply any effects that increase
                  the unit’s maximum speed (up to speed 3), before applying any
                  effects that reduce that unit’s maximum speed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Whether or not a piece of terrain is difficult depends on a
                  unit’s type (trooper, ground vehicle, or repulsor vehicle).

                    >For example, a barricade is difficult terrain for trooper
                    units, but not for vehicle units. Both ground and repulsor
                    vehicle units can move through barricades without incurring
                    any penalties.</em

                      When using custom terrain, it is important to define the

                A unit with the

                always specifically states the unit name, rank, or type of this
                other unit. Each Command Phase, during the Issue Orders step, a
                unit with the
                <strong class="keyword-reference">direct</strong> keyword may
                issue an order to a friendly unit at range 1–2 that meets the

                  Game effects that trigger when a unit is issued an order, such

                  When a ground vehicle or creature trooper mini moves along the

                </li>
                <li>
                  When a repulsor vehicle mini’s final position would overlap

                <li>
                  Trooper units that are engaged cannot be displaced, and thus
                  cannot be moved through by ground vehicles or creature
                  troopers. Repulsor vehicles and other trooper units can move
                  through engaged troopers.

                      Creature and emplacement troopers cannot be displaced, and

              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Set Aside Minis:</strong> Any displaced minis are
                  placed to the side of the battlefield without disrupting other
                  minis or objects on the battlefield. If a unit leader is
                  displaced, a player should mark its original position using a
                  spare token.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Move:</strong> The mini that displaced the trooper
                  minis continues its move as normal, unimpeded by the minis it
                  displaced.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Place Units:</strong> The player who did not move that
                  unit takes all of the displaced minis (both friendly and
                  enemy) and places them back on the battlefield.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Each mini must be placed in cohesion with its unit leader.

                    <li>
                      If a unit leader was displaced, it must be placed at
                      speed-1 of its original position. After the leader is
                      placed, any minis of that unit that are not in cohesion
                      are placed in cohesion; this could cause a mini that was
                      not displaced to be moved.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      When placing a displaced mini, it cannot be placed in base
                      contact with an enemy mini.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      When placing a displaced mini, it must remain on its
                      original elevation, if possible.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Gain Suppression:</strong> Each unit that had one or
                  more minis displaced gains one suppression token.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      A unit cannot gain more than one suppression token due to
                      being displaced in a single activation, even if it is
                      displaced multiple times that activation.
                    </li>

                The lightsaber form of djem so, while seemingly a defensive
                form, is often favored by more aggressively minded Jedi. For a
                djem so master, each strike by an opponent is an opportunity for
                a parry and a devastating counter blow. While a unit with the
                <strong class="keyword-reference">djem so mastery</strong>

              <h4>Dual Sided Cards</h4>
              <p>
                Some upgrade cards are dual sided; these cards represent a
                weapon, piece of gear, or special training that has two
                different modes or states.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  When building an army, if a player includes a dual sided
                  upgrade card, only the points cost on one side of the card
                  count toward the points in their army (both sides always have
                  the same printed points cost).
                </li>
                <li>
                  When deploying a unit equipped with a dual sided upgrade card,
                  the player that controls that unit decides what side of the
                  card is faceup.
                </li>
                <li>
                  During a game, only the faceup side of a dual sided card is
                  active and allowed to be used.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Some dual sided cards have abilities, such as the
                  <strong class="keyword-reference">reconfigure</strong>
                  keyword, that allow the card to be flipped to a different
                  side.

              <p>
                Embarking and disembarking are types of moves that allow a unit
                to enter or exit a vehicle with the
                <strong class="keyword-reference">transport x</strong> or
                <strong class="keyword-reference">light transport x</strong>

              </p>
              <p>
                To embark into a transport with the
                <strong class="keyword-reference">transport x: open</strong>
                keyword, a unit uses 1 action to perform a speed-1 move that
                puts its unit leader into base contact with a friendly vehicle
                that can transport that type of unit.
              </p>
              <p>
                To embark into a transport with the
                <strong class="keyword-reference">transport x: closed</strong>
                keyword, a unit spends its entire activation to perform a
                speed-1 move that puts its unit leader into base contact with a
                friendly vehicle that can transport that type of unit.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then, the unit is removed from the battlefield and a pair of ID
                tokens are placed, one near the base of the vehicle and one next
                to the unit, to indicate that the unit is being transported by
                that vehicle, and its activation ends.
              </p>
              <p>
                To disembark, a unit that is being transported uses 1 action to
                place its unit leader in base contact with the vehicle and then
                performs a speed–1 move with the unit.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  When a unit embarks, any tokens that unit has are moved off
                  the battlefield with the unit. That unit still has those
                  tokens.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When a unit disembarks, any tokens that were moved off the
                  battlefield with the unit are placed back on the battlefield
                  next to the unit. That unit still has those tokens.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When a unit disembarks, if the vehicle that is transporting
                  that unit has performed more than one standard move or reverse
                  during the current round, disembarking uses that unit’s entire
                  activation and it cannot perform additional actions or any
                  free actions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A unit that is disembarking cannot be placed into base contact
                  with any enemy units.

              <h4>Entourage: Unit Name (Unit Keyword)</h4>
              <p>
                The <strong class="keyword-reference">entourage</strong> keyword
                indicates that a unit is often accompanied or protected by
                another specific unit. The
                <strong class="keyword-reference">entourage</strong> keyword
                specifically states the name of this other unit. When building
                an army, if a player includes a unit with the
                <strong class="keyword-reference">entourage</strong> keyword,
                they may ignore the rank (but not points value) of a unit that
                has the name specified by the
                <strong class="keyword-reference">entourage</strong> keyword.
                Ignoring the rank of a unit means that the unit’s rank does not
                count against the rank restrictions for building an army. This
                may cause an army to have more units of a specific rank than the
                rules for building an army normally allow; because of the
                <strong class="keyword-reference">entourage</strong> keyword,
                such an army still meets the rules for building an army of that
                type.

                A player must expend some upgrade cards to resolve the abilities
                on those cards. Once a card is expended, it cannot be used again
                for the rest of that game.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If a card has an expend icon, it requires the player to expend
                  it in order to use its abilities.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To expend a card, a player rotates it 180º so it is oriented
                  upside down. This indicates that the card has been expended.
                </li>
                <li>Expended cards cannot be unexpended by any game effect.</li>
                <li>All upgrade cards begin the game unexpended.</li>
                <li>
                  A card that does not have an expend icon cannot be expended.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The points value of expended cards equipped to units that are
                  defeated are still counted when determining the total points
                  value of defeated units.

              <p>
                Not every hero is faultless and not every villain is unwavering.
                Some characters have critical flaws that come to light at the
                most inopportune times. Each unit that has the
                <strong class="keyword-reference">flawed</strong> keyword has a
                corresponding flaw card. During setup, that unit’s flaw card
                <strong>must</strong> be added to an opponent’s command hand.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the game, that opponent may play the flaw card according
                to the rules described on the card itself. During the End Phase,
                any flaw cards in play are discarded and their effects end.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A unit’s specific flaw card is identified by that unit’s name
                  appearing in the upper right of the flaw cad itself.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Flaw cards can be played only according to the rules on the
                  flaw card itself. Most flaw cards are played at the start of
                  the Command Phase.
                </li>
                <li>Flaw cards are not command cards.</li>
                <li>
                  Flaw cards are placed in an opponent’s command hand for the
                  sake of convenience. Effects that target an opponent’s command
                  hand or command cards <strong>cannot</strong> target or effect
                  a flaw card.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If both players have a flaw card in their hand, at the start
                  of each phase the blue player must decide whether or not to
                  play a flaw card before the red player decides.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When a flaw card is discarded from play, it is placed in the
                  discard pile of the player that controls the associated unit.
                  This is to avoid the card being misplaced after a game.

                If you do, when you deploy a unit with
                <strong class="keyword-reference">field commander</strong>, mark
                that unit with the commander token. That unit keeps its current
                rank; however, as per the rules of
                <strong class="keyword-reference">field commander</strong>, that
                unit may be nominated as a commander when a neutral command card
                is layed. In addition, while that unit has a commander token,
                friendly units at range 1–3 may treat their courage value as 2
                when checking whether they panic.

              <h4>Firing Arcs</h4>
              <p>
                A firing arc is the cone-shaped area formed by the firing-arc
                lines embossed on some miniatures’ bases.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The bases of some minis have firing-arc lines that players use
                  to determine firing arcs for that mini.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Each firing-arc line begins in the center of a mini’s base and
                  ends at the edge of a mini’s base.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      The firing arc between the two firing-arc lines that
                      extend to the front of a mini’s base is that mini’s front
                      firing arc. The two firing-arc lines that form the front
                      firing arc always have a notch between them.

                    <li>
                      The firing arc between the two firing-arc lines that
                      extend to the rear of a mini’s base is that mini’s rear
                      firing arc. The two firing-arc lines that form the rear
                      firing arc always have a notch between them.

                    <li>
                      The firing arc between the two firing-arc lines that
                      extend to the left of a mini’s base is one of that mini’s
                      side firing arcs, and the firing arc between the two
                      firingarc lines that extend to the right of a mini’s base
                      is that mini’s other side firing arc. Together these are
                      that mini’s side firing arcs. The firing arc lines that
                      form the side firing arcs usually do not have notches
                      between them.

                  To determine each of the edges of a unit’s firing arc, a
                  player aligns the edge of the range ruler with the firing-arc
                  line on a unit’s base to create one continuous line.

              <h4>Height</h4>
              <p>
                Height is a vertical measurement of objects on a battlefield. An
                object’s height is measured using the range ruler.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  To measure an object’s height, a player places the end of the
                  range ruler flat on the battlefield’s surface as close to the
                  object as possible; the range ruler should be oriented
                  vertically. The segment of the range ruler that the top of the
                  object is at is equal to that object’s height.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      If the top of the object meets the line between two range
                      ruler segments without crossing that line, that object’s
                      height is equal to the lower range segment that the line
                      separates. Otherwise, the height of the object is equal to
                      the higher range segment that the line separates.

                  Some terrain may have multiple surfaces at various heights.
                  When determining the height of a surface for the purposes of
                  climbing or clambering, a player measures from the surface
                  their miniatures are on to the surface those minis are

                      end their move on is perfectly flat and players should
                      agree before playing as to what terrain units cannot end
                      their movement on; however, as a general rule, if
                      overlapping a piece of terrain causes a mini to be
                      unstable or fall over, or causes the mini’s base to be at
                      an angle greater than 45 degrees, that mini cannot end a
                      move in that position.

                ID tokens help players keep track of multiple units of the same
                type that have different upgrade cards. When deploying such
                units, place a unique ID token near the base of the unit leader
                of each unit. Then, place each unit’s matching ID token on its
                corresponding card.

              <h4>Issuing Orders</h4>
              <p>
                During the Command Phase, when it is a player’s turn to resolve
                their revealed command card, they nominate one of their
                commanders on the battlefield. That commander issues orders to
                the number and type of units presented on the revealed command
                card.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A unit needs to fulfill the following criteria to be issued an
                  order:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      The unit must be of a type presented on the player’s
                      revealed command card.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The unit must be at range 1–3 of the player’s nominated
                      commander.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The unit cannot have already received an order during the
                      current game round.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  When a unit is issued an order, a player places an order token
                  that matches the faction and rank of the unit receiving the
                  orders near that unit on the battlefield; the player places
                  the order token so its rank is faceup.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When playing an operative’s command card, the player does not
                  nominate a commander; instead they nominate the operative, and
                  that operative issues orders.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If a player does not have a commander or operative on the
                  battlefield, that player cannot play a command card during the
                  Command Phase.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Orders are issued one at a time, in an order chosen by the
                  player who controls the unit that is issuing the orders. Any
                  game effects that triggers when or after an order is issued
                  are resolved one at a time, when or after that order is
                  issued, and before any other orders are issued.
                </li>
                <li>
                  During the Command Phase, a unit can be issued an order only
                  once, even if a game effect causes that order to be removed or
                  issued to another unit instead.
                </li>

              <h4>Keywords</h4>
              <p>A keyword is an ability possessed by units or weapons.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  There are two types of keywords: unit keywords and weapon
                  keywords.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      A unit keyword is an inherent ability of a unit and it is
                      presented on a unit’s card or added to a unit by an
                      upgrade card.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      A weapon keyword is an inherent ability of a weapon and is
                      presented as part of a weapon on either a unit’s card or
                      an upgrade card.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Each unit keyword provides a unit with an ability, including
                  the timing of when the ability is used as well as the effect
                  of the ability.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Each weapon keyword adds an ability to the attack pool in
                  which it is included.
                </li>
                <li>
                  All keywords with a numerical value (an “x” value) are
                  cumulative with themselves. This includes both weapon keywords
                  and unit keywords (including unit keywords that are card
                  actions, such as the
                  <strong class="keyword-reference">jump x</strong>
                  keyword).<br /><br /><em
                    >For example, an AT-ST has the arsenal 2 keyword; if that
                    AT-ST uses the free card action on the General Weiss upgrade
                    card to gain arsenal 2, that AT-ST now has arsenal 4.
                    Similarly, when a Stormtrooper unit composed of four minis
                    performs an attack, if each mini chooses to use the weapon
                    on an equipped Impact Grenades upgrade card, the attack pool
                    would consist of four instances of impact 1, and thus the
                    attack pool would have impact 4.</em
                  >
                </li>
                <li>
                  The front of each unit card provides reminder text of each of
                  that unit’s keywords. The back of each unit card provides
                  reminder text for each of that unit’s weapon keywords.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      The reminder text is not an exhaustive description of the
                      rules for a keyword. Rather, it is there to help players
                      remember how and when to resolve each keyword. If a player
                      has questions about how a keyword works, that player
                      should refer to that keyword’s glossary entry.
                    </li>

              <h4>Line of Sight</h4>
              <p>
                Line of sight is used to determine if one mini can see another
                mini. A player determines line of sight from the perspective of
                a mini, using a viewpoint where the center of the mini’s base
                meets the top of the mini’s sculpt. If a player can see part of
                an opponent’s mini, which includes that mini’s base, from that
                viewpoint, that player’s mini has line of sight to that
                opponent’s mini.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If a mini does not have line of sight to another mini, line of
                  sight is blocked.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Pieces of terrain and vehicles can block line of sight.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Trooper minis do not block line of sight. When determining
                      line of sight, if a player cannot see a mini because it is
                      concealed by one or more troopers on the battlefield, and
                      that player could otherwise see the mini, that player’s
                      mini has line of sight to the mini that is concealed by
                      one or more troopers.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  During an attack, each mini in the attacker can contribute
                  dice to the attack pool if that mini has line of sight to
                  <strong>any</strong> mini in the defender.
                </li>
                <li>
                  During an attack, if line of sight to a mini in the defender
                  is blocked from all minis in the attacker, that mini in the
                  defender cannot suffer wounds.
                </li>
                <li>A mini cannot block its own line of sight.</li>
                <li>
                  When determining line of sight from an E-Web Heavy Blaster
                  Team mini, players should check from the top of the head of
                  the snowtrooper who is firing the E-Web, regardless of whether
                  it is directly over the center of the base.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When determining line of sight from a DF-90 Mortar Trooper
                  Mini, players should check from the top of the head of the
                  shoretrooper who is firing the mortar, regardless of whether
                  it is directly over the center of the base.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When determining line of sight from a TX-225 GAVw Occupier,
                  players should check from the center of the roof of the crew
                  compartment, regardless of whether it is directly over the
                  center of the base.

              <h4>Melee</h4>
              <p>
                Melee represents close combat between opposing units. When two
                miniatures from opposing players’ units are in base contact,
                those units are in a melee.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If two trooper units are in a melee, those units are engaged.
                  Any unit type can be in a melee, but only troopers can be
                  engaged.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When a unit performs an attack against a unit that it is in a
                  melee with, that attack is a melee attack. Melee attacks
                  follow the same rules as ranged attacks with the following
                  exceptions:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      The attacker can use only weapons that have the melee
                      (<img
                        class="game-icon"
                        src="img/legion-melee.png"
                        alt="melee icon"
                      />) icon.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The target of the attack must be in the same melee as the
                      attacker.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  If a unit has a melee weapon, it can start a melee by moving
                  into base contact with an enemy miniature. To start a melee, a
                  player must follow these steps in order:
                </li>
              </ul>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Move Unit Leader:</strong> The player performs a move,
                  moving their unit leader into base contact with an enemy mini.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Move Other Minis:</strong> Maintaining cohesion, the
                  player places each other mini in the unit that started the
                  melee into base contact with enemy minis that belong to the
                  same enemy unit that their unit leader is now in melee with.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Opponent Moves Minis:</strong> Maintaining cohesion,
                  the player’s opponent moves any of their own minis that belong
                  to the unit that is now in a melee (that are not already in
                  base contact with an enemy mini) into base contact with minis
                  from the unit that started the melee.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      If the opponent’s unit does not have a melee weapon, the
                      opponent does not move their minis into base contact with
                      the unit that started the melee.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A unit cannot move in such a way that its minis would be
                  placed in base contact with multiple enemy units.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      It is possible for a unit to be in a melee with multiple
                      enemy units if another unit joins later.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  A unit that does not have a melee weapon cannot start a melee.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When moving minis into base contact with enemy minis after a
                  melee has been started, if there is not space to place a mini
                  in base contact with an enemy mini in the same melee, that
                  mini must still be placed in cohesion.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Minis that are not in base contact with an enemy mini can
                  still contribute to a melee attack if the unit to which that
                  mini belongs is in a melee.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Whenever there are minis that are not in base contact with an
                  enemy mini but those minis have a melee weapon and the unit to
                  which they belong is in a melee, those minis must be placed in
                  base contact with an enemy mini in the same melee as their
                  unit if possible. This can happen when minis in a melee suffer
                  wounds and are defeated, creating space for other minis that
                  were not previously in base contact to be placed in base
                  contact.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      If both players own minis that are not in base contact
                      with an enemy mini and should be, the player that is
                      currently activating a unit or has most recently activated
                      a unit (even if that unit is not the unit with minis that
                      should be placed in base contact with enemy minis) should
                      move their minis into base contact with enemy minis before
                      the other player does so. If neither play has activated a
                      unit yet this round, the blue player should move their
                      minis first.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Minis that are no longer in base contact should always be
                      placed back into base contact with an enemy mini if able,
                      even if each enemy mini that was in base contact has just
                      been defeated. This can happen when the defending unit
                      does not have a melee weapon and not all defending minis
                      were in base contact with an enemy mini.<br /><br /><em
                        >For example, Luke Skywalker is in base contact with an
                        enemy 74-Z Speeder Bike mini, while another mini from
                        the same unit is not in base contact with Luke
                        Skywalker. After performing an attack, Luke Skywalker
                        defeats the enemy 74-Z Speeder Bike mini and is no
                        longer is base contact with an enemy mini. Because there
                        is another 74-Z Speeder Bike mini from that unit, Luke
                        Skywalker should immediately be placed into base contact
                        with that mini.</em

                    <li>
                      If for any reason minis cannot be placed back into base
                      contact with an enemy mini and none of the minis belonging
                      to that unit are in base contact with an enemy mini, those
                      minis stay where they are on the battlefield and that unit
                      is no longer in melee.

                  The primary way that units move is by performing a move
                  action. When a unit performs a move action, it performs a
                  standard move, reverse, strafe, pivot, climb, clamber, embark,
                  or disembark.

                <li>
                  To perform a standard move, a player performs the following

              <ol>

                    <li>
                      Each unit has a maximum speed of one, two, or three, which
                      is represented by a number of red bars on the unit’s card.
                      When a unit performs a standard move, it uses a movement
                      tool with a value equal to or less than its maximum speed.

                  <strong>Place Movement Tool:</strong> The player places the
                  movement tool against the moving unit’s base, according to the
                  type of base:
                  <ul>
                    <li>

                      of the movement tool flush against any portion of the unit
                      leader mini’s base.

                    <li>
                      <strong>Notched Base:</strong> The player places one end
                      of the movement tool into the front notch of the vehicle’s
                      base.

                  <strong>Adjust Movement Tool:</strong> The player can adjust
                  the movement tool at its joint, bending it as they desire. The
                  movement tool creates a path along which the mini will move.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Execute Full or Partial Move:</strong> The player
                  executes either a full or partial move.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Full:</strong> Holding the movement tool in place,
                      the player lifts up the unit leader mini and moves it
                      along the path of the movement tool, keeping the mini’s
                      base centered in relation to the width of the tool. Then,
                      if the mini has an unnotched base, the player places the
                      mini’s base flush against the other end of the movement
                      tool; if the mini has a notched base, the player places
                      the mini so the other end of the movement tool is inserted
                      into the rear notch of the mini’s base.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Partial:</strong> Holding the movement tool in
                      place, the player lifts up the unit leader mini and moves
                      it along the path of the movement tool, keeping the mini’s
                      base centered in relation to the width of the tool. Then,
                      the player places the mini anywhere along the path created
                      by the movement tool, moving the movement tool out of the
                      way and placing the mini on the battlefield. When placing
                      a mini with a notched base during a partial move, the unit
                      must be placed such that the central axis of the mini’s
                      front and back notches is parallel to the section of the
                      movement tool the mini reached at the furthest part of its
                      move.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Establish Cohesion:</strong> The player places all
                  minis of the moving unit that are not the unit leader in
                  cohesion with the unit leader. See
                  <a href="#cohesion" class="link-to-c">Cohesion</a>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      When a notched base mini is placed in cohesion, its base
                      must be oriented in the exact same direction as the unit
                      leader’s base.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  During a unit’s activation, it is possible for a unit to
                  perform multiple move actions. Unlike other actions, a unit is
                  not limited to only one move action per activation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  While moving a mini along a path created by a movement tool,
                  if the base of the mini is impeded by an object, that mini
                  must stop its movement prematurely unless the mini can legally
                  move through, over, or on top of the obstructing object.
                </li>

                <li>
                  While performing a standard move, a reverse, or a strafe, if
                  it is obvious that the mini will be unimpeded while moving
                  along the path created by the movement tool, the mini can be
                  placed directly at its final destination.
                </li>
                <li>
                  While moving a unit, if a movement tool cannot lie flat on the
                  battlefield, the player can hold the tool above any objects
                  that prevent the tool from lying flat, or mark the objects’
                  positions and move them out of the way while performing the
                  move.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A mini can move into base contact with an enemy mini only if
                  the unit performing the move has a melee weapon and is
                  entering into a melee with that enemy unit.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If a unit performs a move that causes any part of its unit
                  leader's base to be outside of the battlefield, including
                  while moving along a movement tool, that unit is defeated.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Unless a unit is able to displace other minis, the final
                  position of a unit after a move cannot overlap the bases of
                  other minis.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The final position of a unit after a move cannot overlap
                  objective or condition tokens.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The bases of minis can partially overhang ledges, as long as
                  the mini is stable and is not precariously placed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A unit must be placed as flat as possible on the battlefield
                  after performing any type of move. Not all terrain that a unit
                  could end their move on top of is perfectly flat and players
                  should agree before playing as to what terrain units cannot
                  end their movement on; however, as a general rule, if
                  overlapping a piece of terrain causes a mini to be unstable or
                  fall over, or causes the mini’s base to be at an angle greater
                  than 45 degrees, that mini cannot end a move in that position.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If a game effect allows or forces a unit to perform a
                  “speed-x” move, that unit performs a full or partial standard
                  move with a speed equal to or lower than “x.” Climbing,
                  clambering, embarking, disembarking, reversing, strafing, and
                  pivoting are not standard moves and thus cannot be performed
                  in place of a speed-x move.
                </li>

              <h4>Notch</h4>
              <p>
                Some units, notably vehicles, have front and rear notches on
                their bases.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  When a mini with a notched base performs a move, a player
                  places the movement tool into either the front or rear notch
                  on the base.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      When performing a standard move, they begin by placing the
                      start of the movement tool into the front notch of the
                      mini’s base. When finishing a full move, they place the
                      rear notch of the mini’s base onto the end of the movement
                      tool.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      When performing a reverse, they begin by placing the start
                      of the movement tool into the rear notch of the mini’s
                      base. When finishing a full reverse, they place the front
                      notch of the mini’s base onto the end of the movement
                      tool.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  When a mini with a notched base is placed in cohesion, its
                  base must be oriented in the exact same direction as the unit
                  leader’s base.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When a mini with a notched base climbs or clambers, its base
                  must be oriented in the exact same direction as it was before
                  it climbed or clambered.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The space created by the notch in a mini's base should be
                  treated as a part of that mini's base by other minis.
                  Therefore, no mini’s base may be placed inside the notches of
                  another mini’s base.

              <p>
                When an observation token is assigned to a unit, it means that
                the enemy has gained an advantage over them by observing some
                critical weakness or flaw. Various effects can cause enemy units
                to gain observation tokens. During an attack, the attacking unit
                can spend any observation tokens that belong to the defending
                unit. The attacker rerolls one attack die for each observation
                token spent. Observation tokens are removed at the end of each
                round.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Observation tokens are spent by the attacker during the
                  “Reroll Dice” substep of the “Roll Attack Dice” step of an
                  attack.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Observation tokens are spent one at a time; reroll one attack
                  die each time an observation token is spent. The same die can
                  be rerolled multiple times by spending subsequent observation
                  tokens or aim tokens.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The attacker may spend aim tokens and observation tokens in
                  any order.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Observation tokens are placed on the battlefield near to the
                  unit that gained them, and remain with the unit as it moves
                  around the battlefield.
                </li>
                <li>A unit cannot spend its own observation tokens.</li>

                icon indicates that a unit has the rank of operative. Operatives
                are powerful villains and heroes, but they rarely issue orders
                to other units. When building a standard army, a player may
                include up to two operative units.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Each operative has several command cards specific to that

                  When playing an operative’s command card, the player does not
                  nominate a commander; instead they nominate the operative, and
                  that operative issues orders.

                <li>
                  Any units indicated on an operative’s command card can be
                  issued orders only if they are at range 1–3 of the nominated
                  operative. A nominated operative is at range 1–3 of itself.

                  If all of a players commanders have been defeated, an
                  operative can be promoted to be a new commander. If promoted
                  in this way, it loses the rank of operative and can be
                  nominated as a commander and can issue orders using
                  non-operative-specific command cards during the Command Phase.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When an operative is defeated, their operative-specific

                During the Command Phase, each player creates an order pool that

                  When activating a unit during the Activation Phase, a player
                  can choose to take an order token at random from their order
                  pool.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Then, the player activates a unit with a rank that
                      corresponds to the rank on the order token they took.

                </li>
                <li>
                  It is recommended that players create their order pool by
                  placing their order tokens in an opaque bag or container;
                  however, players can also create their order pool by placing

                  If a player draws a token that does not match the rank of a

                  pool and a new one is drawn.

                <li>
                  During the Activation Phase, a player either activates a
                  friendly unit with a faceup order token or takes a random
                  order token from their order pool and activates a friendly

                />) icon is an overrun weapon. Overrun weapons can be used only
                during overrun attacks. A unit may make X overrun attacks during
                its activation.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A unit with an overrun weapon can perform an overrun attack
                  after it performs a standard move in which it moved through an
                  enemy unit. After completing the move and resolving any
                  displacement, the unit with the overrun weapon performs an
                  attack against the unit it moved through using only its
                  <strong class="keyword-reference">overrun</strong> weapon.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      If a unit can perform multiple overrun attacks during its
                      activation, it must perform a separate move through an
                      enemy unit for each overrun attack.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Overrun attacks are not ranged attacks. Game effects that
                  apply to ranged attacks do not apply to overrun attacks. For
                  example:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Overrun attacks ignore cover</li>
                    <li>
                      Fire Support cannot be used during an overrun attack.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Overrun attacks do not cause the defender to gain 1
                      suppression token, unless the overrun attack has the
                      <strong class="keyword-reference">suppressive</strong>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  After the “Rally” step of a unit’s activation, if the unit has
                  a number of suppression tokens that is equal to or greater
                  than double its courage value, that unit is panicked.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      If a unit is at range 1–3 of a friendly commander, it may
                      use that commander’s courage value instead of its own when
                      checking if it is panicked.

                  When a unit becomes panicked, it gains a panic token. The
                  token is placed on the battlefield near the unit leader and
                  will remain with the unit as it moves around the battlefield.

                <li>
                  After the “Rally” step of a unit’s activation, if that unit is
                  panicked, it can perform only one action instead of two, and
                  that action must be a move action toward the nearest
                  battlefield edge.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When performing its move action, a panicked unit must attempt
                  to move off of the battlefield as efficiently as possible.
                  That is, the unit must move the entire length of the movement
                  tool in the direction of the battlefield edge to which that
                  unit is closest. If a unit can move off the battlefield more
                  efficiently by moving along an indirect path that avoids
                  terrain, the unit should move along that path. After the unit
                  leader is moved, however, any remaining minis in the unit are
                  placed in cohesion as normal. If the unit leader leaves the
                  battlefield, the unit is defeated.

              <h4>Pivot</h4>
              <p>
                A pivot is a type of movement that allows a mini with a notched
                base to change the orientation of its base.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  When a mini pivots, that mini can rotate its base up to
                  90&#176; in either direction.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To pivot, a player rotates the unit leader’s base around the
                  base’s center point. The center point of the unit leader’s
                  base should remain in place throughout the pivot.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If a notched-base unit contains multiple miniatures, each mini
                  in the unit must pivot so the orientation of its base matches
                  the orientation of the unit leader’s base.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A unit can pivot while in difficult terrain without suffering
                  any penalties.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If a game effect triggers by a unit moving, that game effect
                  triggers by pivoting.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When a mini with a non-round base pivots, it cannot overlap
                  other mini’s bases, unless it is able to displace those minis.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When a ground vehicle pivots, if it has a non-round base, it
                  displaces friendly and enemy trooper minis.

              <h4>Range</h4>
              <p>
                Range is the distance between two miniatures on the battlefield.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Melee range is when a mini is in base contact with an enemy
                  mini. Those minis are at melee range with each other.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Players measure other ranges using the range ruler. The range
                  ruler consists of five segments of equal length. The beginning
                  segment represents range 1, the second segment represents
                  range 2, etc.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      The beginning of the range ruler has a flat, raised end.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Each range segment is an entire plastic section of the
                      ruler.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  To measure range, a player places the start of the range ruler
                  so it touches the base of the mini that range is being
                  measured from. Then, they point the range ruler toward the
                  mini that range is being measured to. The number of segments
                  (and partial segments) of the range ruler that lie between the
                  bases of the two minis is the range.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      If the base of the mini being measured to touches the
                      raised line between two range ruler segments without
                      crossing it, the mini is at the lower range segment that

                      When a player is measuring using the range ruler, that
                      player should use a single edge of the range ruler; the
                      player should not factor the width or thickness of the
                      ruler.

                    <li>
                      Range is always measured horizontal to the battlefield, on
                      a two-dimensional plain. If two minis are on different
                      elevations, to measure range, the player should hold the
                      range ruler above both minis, level with the battlefield,
                      and look down from above to determine range.

                  When measuring to range 5, if players do not have access to a

                  mark that point, and then measure range 4 from that point to

              <h4>Recover</h4>
              <p>
                A unit can recover by performing a recover action. When a unit
                recovers, a player removes any number of suppression tokens from
                that unit and readies any number of the unit’s exhausted upgrade
                cards.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Unit abilities and other game effects can allow units to
                  recover. If a game effect specifically instructs a unit to
                  recover, that effect is different than performing a recover
                  action and therefore does not trigger abilities that occur
                  after recover actions are performed.

                <li>
                  A pivot performed with the reposition keyword is a move. It is

                  While a panicked unit with the reposition keyword attempts to

                certain card effects allow a player to restore minis to friendly
                units. To restore a mini to a unit, that unit must have had one
                or more minis defeated that round. Choose a mini that was
                defeated during the current round and place that mini on the
                battlefield in cohesion with its unit leader. Then, give that
                mini a number of wound tokens equal to one less than the wound

                  If all of a unit’s minis have been defeated, then that unit is

                  If cards in a player’s army have the ability to restore minis,
                  it is recommended that the player track which of their minis
                  have been defeated during the current round, in order to avoid
                  confusion. For example, minis can be tipped on their side and
                  temporarily left on the battlefield near their unit until the
                  round ends, or marked in some way that is clear to both

                  When performing a reverse, a player begins by placing the

                  notch on the mini’s base onto the end of the movement tool. A
                  player can perform a partial reverse with a mini if they

                      Performing a reverse while having 1 or more immobilize

                within an enemy deployment zone. At the end of the game, if that
                unit has at least 1 victory token, used the
                <strong class="keyword-reference">secret mission</strong>

              <p>
                The <strong class="keyword-reference">speeder x</strong> keyword
                indicates that a vehicle is constantly in motion, as represented
                by compulsory moves, while also indicating the height of terrain
                the vehicle can freely move over.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A unit with the
                  <strong class="keyword-reference">speeder x</strong> keyword
                  must perform a free compulsory move action at the
                  <strong>start</strong> or <strong>end</strong> of the Perform
                  Actions step of its activation.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      A compulsory move is a free standard move action, and
                      therefore triggers abilities that occur after move actions
                      are performed. However, as a free action, it does not
                      count against the unit’s two actions per activation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      To perform a compulsory move, the unit performs a full
                      move at its maximum speed. If it cannot do so, or if a
                      full move would cause any part of the unit leader’s base
                      to be outside the battlefield, it can perform a partial
                      move instead, ending its movement as far along the
                      movement template as possible. If the unit performs a
                      partial movement in this way, the unit suffers a number of
                      wounds equal to its maximum speed.
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          If the unit leader ends this movement with any part of
                          its base outside of the battlefield, the unit is
                          defeated.
                        </li>

                      compulsory move. If it is performing a compulsory move,
                      its final position can overlap trooper minis. If its final
                      position after performing a compulsory move would overlap
                      one or more trooper minis, those trooper minis are
                      displaced.

                          Troopers that are engaged cannot be displaced by a

                          position after performing a compulsory move would
                          overlap an engaged trooper, it must perform a partial

                  must still be placed as flat as possible on the battlefield
                  after performing any type of move. Not all terrain that a unit
                  could end their move on top of is perfectly flat and players
                  should agree before playing as to what terrain units cannot
                  end their movement on; however, as a general rule, if
                  overlapping a piece of terrain causes a mini to be unstable or
                  fall over, or causes the mini’s base to be at an angle greater
                  than 45 degrees, that mini cannot end a move in that position.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      If a unit performing a compulsory move cannot complete a
                      full move without overlapping a piece of terrain that is
                      not flat enough to be placed on top of, it must perform a
                      partial move instead, and suffer damage equal to its
                      maximum speed.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  The final position of a unit after any move cannot overlap

                <li>
                  When a unit performs a compulsory move, the bases of the minis
                  in the unit can partially overhang ledges, as long as each
                  mini is stable and is not precariously placed. If there is not
                  room to place a unit leader’s base on the surface that the
                  unit is moving onto, or if any mini’s base cannot be placed
                  legally and maintain cohesion, that unit cannot complete the
                  compulsory move.
                </li>
                <li>
                  During a compulsory move, if the unit leader would end its

                  the

                  along the movement tool by a distance no greater than half the
                  length of its base, so that its base is able to be placed
                  legally on the battlefield or terrain piece. It may not do so
                  if the terrain is not ignored by the
                  <strong class="keyword-reference">speeder x</strong> keyword

                      A unit leader’s base may only be moved backwards along the

                    <li>
                      A unit leader must still move as far along the movement

                Game effects often call for units to spend tokens or spend

                <li>
                  When a unit spends an action, it loses that action. In order
                  to spend more than one action, a unit must be able to perform
                  two consecutive actions, and cannot have lost an action from
                  being suppressed or damaged. <br /><br />

                effective against units that comprise multiple miniatures. When
                a mini adds a weapon that has the
                <strong class="keyword-reference">spray</strong> keyword to the
                attack pool, that weapon contributes its dice a number of times
                equal to the number of minis in the defender that are in line of
                sight of the mini using that weapon.<br /><br /><em
                  >For example, if a weapon has the spray keyword and one black
                  attack die icon, it contributes three black attack dice to the
                  attack pool when targeting a unit that comprises three
                  minis.</em

                A standard move is the most common way that units maneuver
                across the battlefield. To perform a standard move, a unit
                places a movement tool against the base of its unit leader and
                moves that leader along the tool. If it is a notched base, the
                movement tool is placed in the notch in the front of the unit
                leader's base.

                Troopers and ground vehicles can perform the standby action. A
                unit can only perform the standby action if it has not performed
                an attack during its activation. To perform a standby action, a
                player places a standby token on the battlefield near the unit
                leader.

                After an enemy unit attacks, moves, or performs an action, if
                that unit is at range 1–2 and in line of sight of a unit with a
                standby token, that unit may spend that standby token to perform
                a free attack action or a free move action.

              <ul>

                <li>
                  If a trooper unit gains a suppression token or performs a

                  During the End Phase, all unspent standby tokens are returned

                <li>
                  A unit must have line of sight to an enemy unit moving,

                  A unit with a standby token measures range from any mini in
                  its unit to any mini in the enemy unit that attacked, moved,
                  or performed an action. However, when spending a standby token
                  to perform an attack, the range of the
                  <strong>attack</strong> is still measured from the unit leader
                  of the attacking unit to any mini in the defending unit.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A standby token may be spent <strong>before</strong> any

                  move action.<br /><br /><em

                    attack with the “Saber Throw” upgrade card, the Rebel
                    Troopers spend their standby token to perform a move, taking
                    them beyond range 2 of Darth Vader. With no enemy unit in
                    range 1–2, Darth Vader can no longer perform an attack.</em

                    <li>
                      Gaining a suppression token is a part of an attack, and
                      not an effect that triggers after an attack. Thus a
                      trooper unit cannot spend a standby token after defending
                      against an attack before it would gain a suppression token
                      and remove its standby token.

                    <li>
                      If a unit is defeated by an enemy unit performing an
                      attack by spending a standby token, the defeated unit
                      cannot then trigger other effects.<br /><br /><em
                        >For example, a unit of Snowtroopers performs a move and

                        token to perform a free attack action. During the
                        attack, the Snowtroopers suffer wounds exceeding their
                        total health and are defeated. Because the Snowtroopers

              <h4>Strafe</h4>
              <p>
                Strafing is a type of movement unique to units with the
                <strong class="keyword-reference">hover</strong> keyword and
                that have side notches on their base. A strafe is a sideways
                movement in which the unit generally maintains the same facing.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  To perform a strafe, place the end of a movement tool into one
                  of the side notches on the unit’s base. Keeping the movement
                  tool in place on the battlefield, lift the unit and place the
                  <strong>opposite</strong> side notch into the
                  <strong>opposite</strong> end of the movement tool.
                </li>
                <li>
                  While performing a strafe, a mini moves along the path created
                  by the movement tool and its base must not overlap terrain or
                  units that it cannot move through.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      A mini may stop moving anywhere along the path of the
                      movement tool to perform a partial move.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  A player can adjust the joint of the movement tool while
                  performing a strafe.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A unit reduces its speed by 1, to a minimum of 1, while
                  performing a strafe.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Strafing through difficult terrain can cause a unit’s
                      speed to be reduced by 2, but only to a minimum of 1.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Performing a strafe while having 1 or more immobilize
                      tokens can cause a unit’s speed to be zero.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  A strafe is a move. It is not a standard move or a speed-x
                  move.
                </li>
                <li>
                  While performing a strafe, a repulsor vehicle mini can move
                  onto or over a piece of a terrain that has a height that is
                  equal to or less than the height of the unit leader’s mini.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Only units with both the
                  <strong class="keyword-reference">hover</strong> keyword and

                    <li>
                      A unit with the

                      but without side notches cannot strafe.

                Units can gain suppression tokens in various ways. Units with

              <ul>
                <li>
                  When a unit gains a suppression token, a player takes a
                  suppression token from the supply and places it on the
                  battlefield next to that unit.
                </li>

                  If a trooper unit has one or more suppression tokens assigned

                  Immediately after the “Rally” step of a trooper unit’s

                straddles the line between the light and the dark side of the

                  during the same timing window, the player controlling that
                  unit decides the order of those effects.<br /><br /><em

                    into base contact with the side of a height 1 building. The

                    charge token and an enemy unit with a standby token. The

                  Each unit card has an upgrade bar that contains a number of
                  upgrade icons. For each icon on a unit’s upgrade bar, that
                  unit can equip one upgrade card that has the matching icon.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      A unit cannot equip more than one copy of the same upgrade
                      card.

                    <li>
                      Each upgrade card has a point value displayed in its
                      lower-right corner. When building an army, a player may
                      spend points to equip upgrade cards to the units in their
                      army.

                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Some upgrade cards have restrictions in their card text, such
                  as “Stormtroopers only,” “Light Side only,” or “Dark Side
                  only.” When equipping upgrades, players must obey those
                  restrictions.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Only a unit that has the name indicated in the restriction
                      can equip upgrades restricted to a unit name (e.g., only a
                      unit named “Stormtroopers” can equip a “Stormtroopers
                      only” card).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Only units of the Galactic Empire or the Separatist
                      Alliance factions can equip upgrades with a “Dark Side
                      only” restriction.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Only units of the Rebel Alliance or the Galactic Republic
                      factions can equip upgrades with a “Light Side only”
                      restriction.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Some upgrade cards have an upgrade icon restriction, such as
                  “<img

                  />
                  icon only.” To equip an upgrade card with an upgrade icon
                  restriction, a unit must have the corresponding upgrade icon
                  on its unit card in addition to any other requirements.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      An upgrade icon restriction does not occupy the upgrade
                      icon of a unit and that unit may still equip an upgrade
                      card of that upgrade type.
                    </li>

                </li>

                    <li>
                      Trooper upgrades add specific trooper minis to a unit,
                      represented by unique sculpts to easily identify them.
                      These minis share the defense value, wound threshold, and
                      weapons of the unit card they are equipped to, but may
                      have an additional weapon of their own.

                  do not add any minis to a unit; instead, every mini in that
                  unit may use that weapon when attacking the enemy.

                When a vehicle suffers wounds equal to or exceeding its
                resilience value, the player that controls that vehicle rolls a
                red defense die and the vehicle gains a type of vehicle damage
                token as determined by the die roll. For rules on gaining

              <h4>Vehicles</h4>
              <p>
                A vehicle is a unit type that consists of one or more miniatures
                affixed to a notched base.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  There are two subtypes of vehicles: repulsor and ground. Each
                  unit’s type or subtype is presented on its unit card beneath
                  that unit’s artwork.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Most vehicles have a resilience value, which determines the
                  amount of wounds that can be assigned to that vehicle before
                  it is damaged, disabled, or have one of its weapons disrupted.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Some vehicles do not have a resilience value. These units
                      have a “–” on their unit card where a resilience value
                      would normally be. These vehicles cannot be damaged,
                      disabled, or have one of their weapons disrupted.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  The base of each vehicle is embossed with lines that create
                  firing arcs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The base of each vehicle features both a front and rear notch.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      When performing a standard move with a vehicle, a player
                      inserts a movement tool into the vehicle’s front notch.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      When performing a reverse with a vehicle, a player inserts
                      the movement tool into the vehicle’s rear notch.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  The vehicle movement rules are as follows:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Ground vehicles and repulsor vehicles can pivot.</li>
                    <li>
                      Ground vehicles can reverse, but repulsor vehicles cannot.
                      Ground vehicles are the only units that can reverse.
                    </li>
                    <li>Vehicles cannot climb or clamber.</li>
                    <li>
                      Ground vehicles can move through repulsor vehicles but not
                      other ground vehicles.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Ground vehicles can move through and end their movement
                      overlapping troopers and displace them when doing so.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Ground vehicles with a non-round base displace trooper
                      minis when they pivot.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Repulsor vehicles can move through troopers and vehicles.
                      Only repulsor vehicles can move through ground vehicles.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Ground vehicles can perform the standby action, but repulsor
                  vehicles cannot.
                </li>
                <li>Vehicles can be in a melee but cannot be engaged.</li>
                <li>
                  Ground vehicles can obscure other minis and thus provide other
                  units with cover; repulsor vehicles do not obscure other minis
                  and do not provide cover.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Walking ground vehicles with legs typically provide light
                      cover.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Wheeled or treaded ground vehicles provide heavy cover.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Vehicles can block line of sight.</li>
              </ul>

                      The reminder text is not an exhaustive description of the

                      has questions about how a keyword works, that player
                      should refer to that keyword’s glossary entry.

                A player wins the game either by defeating all their opponent’s
                units or by earning the most victory tokens after six rounds.

                </li>
                <li>
                  If neither player is eliminated after six game rounds, the
                  game ends and the player with the most victory tokens is the
                  winner.

                      If both players have an equal number of victory tokens,
                      the player with the highest score wins. A player’s score
                      is equal to the total point value of each enemy unit that
                      was defeated. This point value includes the point value of
                      the unit and the point values of its equipped upgrades. If
                      this still results in a tie, the Blue Player wins.

              <h4>Within (Range)</h4>
              <p>
                Within is a term used on cards and in the rulebook when
                describing range. A unit is within a range if the entirety of
                the miniature’s base is inside the segment that corresponds to
                that range.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  A unit can be within a range that extends through multiple
                  segments. <br /><br /><em

                    of the mini’s base is somewhere inside the first and second
                    range segments of the range ruler.</em

                Each miniature in a player’s army has a wound threshold
                presented on its unit card.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A wound threshold indicates how many wounds a mini can suffer.
                  If a mini suffers a number of wounds equal to its wound
                  threshold, that mini is defeated and removed from the
                  battlefield.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Some upgrade cards which add minis to a unit feature their
                      own wound threshold icon. These minis use this wound
                      threshold instead of the wound threshold of the unit they
                      are equipped to.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If a mini with the leader keyword and a wound threshhold
                      of 2 is defeated while in a unit with a wound threshhold
                      of 1, replace one of the remaining minis in that unit as
                      normal, then assign the mini with the leader keyword 1
                      wound token.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  When a player’s unit suffers wounds, that player chooses a
                  mini from that unit and assigns wound tokens to that mini
                  until either all wounds are suffered or that mini is defeated.
                  If there are unassigned wounds remaining after a mini is
                  defeated, the player choses another mini from the same unit
                  and repeats this process until either every mini in the unit
                  is defeated or all wounds have been suffered.
                </li>
                <li>
                  During an attack, if line of sight to a mini in the defender
                  is blocked from all minis in the attacker, that mini in the
                  defender cannot suffer wounds.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A mini with at least one wound token assigned to it is
                  wounded. When assigning wound tokens, wounded minis must be
                  chosen to suffer wounds before minis that do not have wound
                  tokens. If the unit leader is wounded, it must be chosen to
                  suffer wounds before minis that do not have wound tokens. If
                  two or more minis in the same unit are wounded, the unit with
                  more wounds must be chosen to suffer wounds before minis with
                  fewer wounds.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A unit with at least one wounded mini is considered wounded.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When a vehicle suffers wounds, if this causes it to have wound
                  tokens equal to or exceeding its resilience value, that player
                  rolls a red defense die and suffers one of the following
                  results:
                  <ul>
                    <li>

                        alt="block symbol"
                      />), the unit is damaged and gains a damaged token. When a
                      player activates a damaged unit, they roll a white defense
                      die. If the result is a blank, that vehicle performs one
                      fewer action during its activation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Disabled:</strong> If the result is a blank, the
                      unit is disabled and gains a disabled token. A unit that
                      is disabled cannot reverse and must spend two actions to
                      perform a standard move.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Weapon Disrupted:</strong> If the result is a
                      defense surge (<img
                        class="game-icon"

                        alt="Defense Surge symbol"
                      />), one of the unit’s weapons is disrupted. The player’s
                      opponent chooses one of that unit’s weapons and a weapon
                      disrupted token is placed on the corresponding card. When
                      adding that weapon to an attack pool, only half its dice
                      can be added (of any color, rounding up).
