              <h4>Actions</h4>
              <p>
                Actions are how units of miniatures move and fight their way
                across the battlefield. A unit will typically perform two
                actions during its activation. The following actions are
                available to every unit.
              </p>

                  >
                  The unit gains an aim token, which allows it to reroll up to
                  two dice when attacking.

                  The unit performs an action listed on its Unit Card, one of
                  its Upgrade Cards, a Command Card, or a Battle Card. Free card
                  actions do not cost the unit any actions to perform. Free card
                  actions have this symbol
                  <img src="/img/legion-free-action.png" class="game-icon" />. A
                  unit may perform more than one free card action, as long as
                  they are different. A unit may only perform free actions
                  during its Perform Actions step and may only perform each
                  instance of a free action once per activation. Free actions do
                  not allow a unit to perform a non-move action more than once
                  during its activation.

                  When a unit performs a move action, it performs a standard

                  A unit that performs a recover action removes any number of

                  unit’s exhausted Upgrade Cards.

                  The unit gains a standby token, which it can use to perform

              </div>
              <h5>Rallying</h5>
              <p>
                Each time a unit activates, it has a chance to rally and remove
                suppression tokens. To rally a unit, its controlling player
                rolls one white defense die for each suppression token the unit
                has. Then its controlling player removes one suppression token
                for each
                <img src="/img/legion-block.png" class="game-icon" /> or
                <img src="/img/legion-defense-surge.png" class="game-icon" />
                result rolled.
              </p>
              <p>
                After rallying, if a unit begins its Perform Actions step while
                suppressed, it performs one fewer action during its Perform
                Actions step.
              </p>
              <p>
                If a unit begins its Perform Actions step while panicked, it
                cannot perform any actions or free actions and drops any claimed
                objective tokens it may have. Then, if a unit did not perform
                any actions or free actions due to panic, at the end of the
                unit’s activation, it removes suppression tokens equal to its
                courage value.
              </p>
              <h5>EXAMPLE: SUPPRESSED AND PANICKED</h5>
              <p class="example-text">
                On Ryan’s turn, he chooses to activate a Clone Trooper unit with
                two suppression tokens. After resolving any effects at the start
                of the Clone Trooper unit’s activation, he performs the unit’s
                Rally step and rolls two white defense dice, one for each
                suppression token. Unfortunately, he rolls two blanks and does
                not remove any suppression tokens from the unit. Because the
                Clone Troopers have a courage value of 1 and have a number of
                suppression tokens equal to or greater than their courage value,
                they are still suppressed and must perform one fewer action
                during the Perform Actions step of their activation.
              </p>
              <p class="example-text">
                Additionally, because the Clone Troopers have suppression equal
                to or greater than double their courage value, they are still
                panicked as well as suppressed. Therefore, they drop any claimed
                objective tokens, perform no actions or free actions, and at the
                end of their activation, they remove suppression tokens equal to
                their courage value.
              </p>
              <div class="callout">
                <h5>COMMANDERS AND CHECKING FOR PANIC</h5>
                <p>
                  When a unit checks to see if it is panicked, instead of using
                  its own courage value, it may use the courage value of a
                  friendly
                  <img
                    src="/img/legion-commander-icon-white.png"
                    class="game-icon"
                  />
                  unit at range 1–3. For example, a unit with 3 suppression
                  tokens and courage value 1 would not be panicked if it chooses
                  to use the courage value of a friendly
                  <img
                    src="/img/legion-commander-icon-white.png"
                    class="game-icon"
                  />
                  at range 1–3 that has a courage value of 2 or greater.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div class="callout">
                <h5>NULL COURAGE VALUE</h5>
                <p>
                  Some units have a null courage value, or “-.” These units can
                  never gain or be assigned suppression tokens and cannot be
                  suppressed or panicked. If a unit gains a null courage value
                  through a special rule, it loses any suppression tokens it
                  has, if any.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If a
                  <img
                    src="/img/legion-commander-icon-white.png"

                  />
                  unit has a null courage value, then friendly units at range
                  1–3 may choose to use that
                  <img
                    src="/img/legion-commander-icon-white.png"
                    class="game-icon"

                  unit's courage value and, therefore, never panic, regardless
                  of the number of suppression tokens they might have.

                During the Perform Actions step, a unit may perform up to 2 of
                the actions below. A unit may only perform each action once per

              <h5>Choose a Unit to Activate or Pass</h5>
              <p>
                The active player chooses to either activate a friendly unit
                with a faceup order token or to draw an order token randomly
                from the order pool and activate a unit matching that order
                token’s rank. If a player draws an order token with a rank that
                does not have any corresponding units on the battlefield, remove
                that token from the game and randomly draw another order token
                from the order pool. Alternatively, a player may be able to
                pass.
              </p>
              <p>
                A player may pass if they have fewer remaining orders than their
                opponent. To see how many remaining orders a player has, add
                together the number of faceup order tokens their army has on the
                battlefield, in that player’s order pool, and on their Command
                Cards.
              </p>
              <p>
                When a player chooses to pass, they do not activate a unit and
                their turn ends. A player can only pass once per round.
              </p>
              <h5>Activating a Unit</h5>
              <p>
                When a unit is chosen to activate, it first attempts to rally,
                and then the unit may perform actions. After the unit has
                completed its actions, flip the unit’s faceup order token
                facedown or assign it the drawn order token facedown.

              <h5>Resolve End of Activation Phase Effects</h5>
              <p>
                When all units on the battlefield have been activated, both
                players’ order pools are empty, and neither player has order
                tokens on Command Cards, resolve any effects that occur at the
                end of the Activation Phase.
              </p>
              <p>

                represented by an icon in the upper left corner of their Unit

                A unit that performs an aim action gains an aim token which it
                can use to reroll dice during attacks.
              </p>
              <p>
                A unit may spend any number of aim tokens while it is attacking
                to reroll up to two different attack dice for each aim token
                spent. If a unit has multiple aim tokens, that unit can choose
                to spend each aim token after determining the results of any
                previous rerolls granted by aim tokens. A unit may reroll the
                same die multiple times by spending multiple aim tokens, but
                each die may only be rerolled once per aim token.

              <p>
                Some terrain features consist of an area of terrain containing
                multiple terrain elements inside a boundary or footprint, like a
                forest, craters, ruined buildings, or piles of rubble. The
                individual elements and their locations inside the area terrain
                are not relevant, only the boundary.
              </p>
              <p>
                When determining the size of area terrain, imagine a silhouette
                beginning at the bottom of the area terrain and extending
                upwards to the tallest point of the terrain. The volume of this
                silhouette is all part of the area terrain. It is up to the
                players to determine the height, the boundaries, special rules,
                and the type of cover that area terrain provides.

              <h4>Attack</h4>
              <p>
                Attacks are usually made by units as part of an attack action
                but can be made as part of another rule. A unit may make
                multiple attacks a turn but can only perform one attack action
                per turn, regardless of whether the attack action is a free
                action.

              <p>
                Line of sight (LOS) is used to see if one miniature can “see”

              <h5>Declare Defender</h5>
              <p>
                The first stage in the attack sequence is choosing an enemy unit
                to attack. The attacking player declares they are performing an
                attack action with their unit against an enemy unit, which
                becomes the defending unit. Then, measuring from the attacking
                unit’s unit leader, the attacking player checks to see that the
                defending unit is at range of at least one of the attacking
                unit’s weapons and has at least one miniature in LOS to the
                attacking unit leader. If either of these conditions cannot be
                met, the attack or attack action cannot be made and is wasted.
              </p>

                Sarah has declared an attack action with her unit of Battle
                Droids. The first step of the attack sequence is to declare a
                defender. Measuring from the Battle Droids’ unit leader, Sarah
                chooses an enemy unit that is in range of at least one of the
                Battle Droid’s weapons and that has at least one miniature in
                LOS. In this case, since the Battle Droids’ weapons are range
                1–3, Sarah must choose an enemy unit at range 1–3 of the Battle
                Droids’ unit leader that is also in LOS. Since the Battle Droid
                unit leader has LOS to both Obi-Wan Kenobi and the Clone
                Troopers, and both are in range of at least one of the Battle
                Droids’ weapons, Sarah can choose either as the defending unit.

              <h5>Form Attack Pool</h5>
              <p>
                The attack pool consists of all the attack dice the attacking
                unit rolls against the defending unit. To form the attack pool,
                the attacking player performs the following steps:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Determine Eligible Miniatures:</strong> A miniature in
                  the attacking unit is eligible to add dice to the attack pool
                  if that miniature has LOS to any miniature in the defending
                  unit.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Choose Weapons and Gather Dice:</strong> For each
                  eligible miniature, the attacking player may choose up to one
                  weapon available to the miniature to add to the attack pool,
                  along with any weapon keywords that weapon may have.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  A miniature must meet any requirements to choose a weapon.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A miniature may only add a weapon to an attack pool once
                  throughout the entire attack sequence.

                </li>
                <li>
                  A weapon cannot be chosen if the defending unit is at a range
                  less than the weapon’s minimum range or greater than the
                  weapon’s maximum range, as measured from the attacking unit
                  leader to the closest miniature in the defending unit.
                </li>
                <li>
                  An attack pool cannot contain both melee and ranged weapons.

                <li>An attack pool can consist of different weapons.</li>
                <li>
                  All weapons with an identical name must go in the same attack
                  pool and cannot be split among multiple attack pools.
                </li>
                <li>An attack pool must consist of at least one weapon.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                After the attacking player is done forming the attack pool, they
                gather all the dice for that attack pool and place them on the
                battlefield next to the defending unit.

                Summer has declared an attack with her unit of Battle Droids and
                ensured that the defending unit of Clone Troopers are in range
                and LOS. Next, Summer determines eligible miniatures by checking
                LOS from each individual Battle Droid in the unit. A miniature
                is eligible to contribute dice to an attack pool if it has LOS
                to any miniature in the defending unit. Summer determines that
                all but one of Battle Droids are eligible miniatures. Then, for
                each eligible miniature, Summer chooses one of the weapons
                available to the unit for that miniature to contribute to the
                attack pool. A miniature must meet all requirements, if any, to
                choose a particular weapon. Finally, Summer cannot choose any
                weapons if the Clone Troopers would be closer than the weapon’s
                minimum range or beyond the weapon’s maximum range.
              </p>
              <p class="example-text">
                Since the Clone Troopers are at range 2 and Summer has four
                eligible Battle Droids, she decides to add four range 1–3
                blaster rifles to the attack pool. She gathers the dice for
                these weapons and places them together on the battlefield next
                to the defending unit.

                  Miniatures that are not in base contact with an enemy
                  miniature can still contribute dice to an attack pool with a
                  melee weapon if they belong to a unit in melee. A melee weapon

                If there are any remaining weapons available to a unit that have

                miniatures that have not yet added a weapon to an attack pool,
                the attacking player may repeat steps 1–2 of the attack
                sequence, forming a new attack pool targeting a different
                defending enemy unit than any other attack pool. Weapons cannot

                In the previous example, Sarah put all the Clone Troopers’
                weapons into the same attack pool. If she wishes, she may leave
                the heavy weapon out of the attack pool and instead form a pool
                with only the four blaster rifles, leaving an eligible miniature
                that has not contributed a weapon to an attack pool. After she
                has formed the first attack pool, she may then choose to declare

                  tokens while it is attacking to reroll up to two different
                  attack dice for each aim token spent. If a unit has multiple
                  aim tokens, that unit can choose to spend each aim token after
                  determining the results of any previous rerolls granted by aim
                  tokens. A unit may reroll the same die multiple times by

                  die from the pool. If the attack is a ranged attack, the
                  defending unit may benefit from cover. If the attack is not a
                  ranged attack, players can skip to the Modify Attack Dice
                  step. After spending any dodge tokens, the defending player
                  applies cover to cancel any remaining hit results. To apply
                  cover, the players follow the below steps.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Determine Number of Obscured Miniatures:</strong> The
                  attacking player checks LOS from the attacking unit leader’s
                  silhouette to each miniature in the defending unit. If LOS to
                  any part of the defending miniature’s silhouette is blocked by
                  terrain other than terrain in base contact with the attacking
                  unit leader and a part of the silhouette is still visible, the
                  defending miniature is obscured. If LOS to a miniature is
                  completely blocked, the miniature is obscured. Repeat this
                  process for every miniature in the defending unit.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Determine Cover:</strong> If at least half of the
                  miniatures in the defending unit are obscured, the defending
                  unit has cover. The type of cover is determined by whatever is
                  obscuring the defending unit, providing either heavy or light
                  cover based on the players’ discussion of terrain before the
                  game. If miniatures in the defending unit are obscured by
                  terrain that provides light cover and some by terrain that
                  provides heavy cover, if more than half of the obscured
                  miniatures are obscured by terrain that provides heavy cover,
                  the defending unit has heavy cover. Otherwise, the unit has
                  light cover.<br />
                  A unit with one or more suppression tokens improves its cover
                  by one: a unit with no cover gains light cover, and a unit in
                  light cover gains heavy cover.

                the next step is to apply cover. To do so, Summer checks LOS
                from the Clone Troopers’ unit leader to each miniature in the
                Battle Droid unit. If LOS to any part of a Battle Droid’s

                contact with the Clone Troopers’ unit leader, that Battle Droid
                is obscured. Summer checks LOS and determines that five Battle
                Droids are obscured.

                provide light cover. Because over half of the Battle Droids are
                obscured by heavy cover, the Battle Droids have heavy cover.

                defending results, Brian’s Battle Droids suffer one wound.
              </p>
              <h5>Suffering Wounds and Defeating Miniatures</h5>
              <p>
                When a player’s unit suffers wounds, that player chooses a
                miniature from that unit and assigns wound tokens to it until
                either all wounds have been suffered or the miniature is
                defeated.
              </p>
              <p>
                A miniature is defeated when it has a number of wound tokens
                assigned to it equal to its wound threshold. If there are
                unassigned wounds remaining after a miniature has been defeated,
                the player chooses another miniature from the same unit and
                repeats the process until either all wounds have been assigned
                or all miniatures in the unit have been defeated. When a unit
                suffers wounds from an attack, if the attacker has LOS to only
                some of the miniatures in the defending unit, the defending unit
                cannot suffer wounds greater than the total wound threshold of
                miniatures that are in LOS.
              </p>
              <p>
                A unit leader cannot be assigned wounds unless it is the only
                miniature in the unit.
              </p>
              <p>
                A miniature or unit with at least one wound token is wounded.
                When assigning wound tokens, the wounded miniature with the most
                wound tokens must be chosen before any others when assigning
                wounds and must be assigned wounds until it is defeated. If more
                than one miniature has the same number of wound tokens assigned,
                choose one of those miniatures to assign wounds to.
              </p>
              <p>
                When a miniature is defeated, remove it from the battlefield. If
                a unit leader is defeated and there are still undefeated
                miniatures in the unit, the unit’s controlling player must
                immediately choose another miniature in that unit to become the
                unit leader, replacing that miniature with the unit leader
                miniature.
              </p>
              <p>
                When all of the miniatures in a unit are defeated, the unit is
                defeated. Remove all order tokens for that unit from the
                battlefield.
              </p>

                <h5>Removing Miniatures in Melee</h5>
                <p>
                  When miniatures in melee are defeated, space may be created
                  for the attacking miniatures to advance. After the attack is
                  resolved, starting with the attacking player, each player must
                  place any friendly miniatures that are no longer in base
                  contact with miniatures in the enemy unit into base contact
                  with the enemy unit. The rules of cohesion must still be
                  followed during these placements.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If, for any reason, miniatures cannot be placed back into base
                  contact with an enemy miniature and none of the miniatures
                  belonging to that unit are in base contact with an enemy
                  miniature, those miniatures do not move and that unit is no
                  longer in melee.

                <h5>Effects that Deal or Assign Wounds</h5>
                <p>
                  Some effects deal or assign wounds without going through the
                  attack sequence. These effects are not attacks, so no defense
                  dice are rolled, nor are any suppression tokens assigned. The
                  player that controls the unit suffering wounds assigns the
                  wounds as normal.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some effects explicitly state that a certain miniature in a
                  unit suffers wounds. In this case, the player who controls the
                  effect may assign any wounds suffered in this way, ignoring
                  the normal rules for assigning wounds.
                </p>
              </div>

                After comparing results, Dallas’ unit of five Clone Troopers has
                suffered three wounds from an attack. He then assigns one of the
                wounds to a miniature in the unit. Since all the miniatures in
                the Clone Trooper unit have a wound threshold of 1, the
                miniature that Dallas assigned a wound to is defeated. Since
                there are two unassigned wounds remaining, Dallas chooses
                another miniature from the same unit and repeats the process
                until either all wounds have been suffered or all miniatures in
                the unit have been defeated. Since each Clone Trooper only has a
                wound threshold of 1 and the unit suffered three wounds, this
                means that three Clone Troopers are defeated, leaving two Clone
                Troopers remaining.

                After comparing results, Chris’ unit of three unwounded Wookiees
                has suffered four wounds. He then assigns one of the wounds to a
                miniature in the unit. Because Wookiees have a wound threshold
                of 3, the Wookiee is not defeated when it is assigned the wound,
                and Chris has three more wounds left to assign. However, because
                the Wookiee has at least one wound token assigned to it, it is
                wounded, and Chris MUST choose to assign it any additional wound
                tokens since it has more wound tokens assigned to it than any
                other miniature in the unit. Chris is forced to assign the next
                two wounds to the Wookiee until it reaches its wound threshold
                of 3 and is defeated, leaving one wound left to be assigned.
                Chris must choose a non-unit leader Wookiee to assign the wound
                to. In the future, because the wounded Wookiee has more wound
                tokens than the other, Chris must assign wounds to it first, and
                must continue to do so until it is defeated.

                After resolving steps 1–10 of the attack sequence, if the

                player chooses another attack pool to resolve against a
                defending unit, performing an attack against it by repeating
                steps 4–11 of the attack sequence.

                Summer has declared an attack with her unit of Battle Droids and
                ensured that the defending unit of Clone Troopers are in range
                and LOS. Next, Summer determines eligible miniatures by checking
                LOS from each individual Battle Droid in the unit. A miniature
                is eligible to contribute dice to an attack pool if it has LOS
                to any miniature in the defending unit. Summer determines that
                all but one of Battle Droids are eligible miniatures. Then, for
                each eligible miniature, Summer chooses one of the weapons
                available to the unit for that miniature to contribute to the
                attack pool. A miniature must meet all requirements, if any, to
                choose a particular weapon. Finally, Summer cannot choose any
                weapons if the Clone Troopers would be closer than the weapon’s
                minimum range or beyond the weapon’s maximum range.

              <p class="example-text">
                Since the Clone Troopers are at range 2 and Summer has four
                eligible Battle Droids, she decides to add four range 1–3
                blaster rifles to the attack pool. She gathers the dice for
                these weapons and places them together on the battlefield next
                to the defending unit.

                Cad Bane has a set of three unique Bane tokens that he can place

                droid troopers, and Wookiee troopers are on small bases.

              <h4>Base Contact</h4>
              <p>
                Many rules in Star Wars: Legion use the term “base contact,"
                which means that the miniature must be touching whatever the
                rule is referencing. This includes another miniature's base, a
                piece of terrain, or a token.
              </p>
              <p>
                Miniatures cannot move into base contact with miniatures from
                enemy units unless the unit leader has a melee weapon (<img
                  scr="img/legion-melee.png"
                  alt="melee icon"
                  class="game-icon"
                />). If the unit leader does, the unit leader can perform a move
                into base contact with an enemy miniature to start a melee. For
                more information on melee combat, see
                <strong class="keyword-reference"
                  ><a href="#melee">Melee</a></strong
                >.
              </p>
              <p>
                Because a miniature’s base can be placed on top of uneven
                terrain, there are situations in which another miniature cannot
                be placed into physical base contact with the first miniature
                because of a difference in elevation between the two bases. In
                these situations, if the following two conditions are met, those
                miniatures are treated as if they are in base contact: when
                viewed from above, there is no space between the two miniature’s
                bases, such that if they were not on differing elevations or
                were both flat on the battlefield, their bases would be
                touching, and the vertical distance between the two bases is no
                greater than the height of the lower miniature’s silhouette. For
                more information on silhouettes, see

              <p>
                Battle Cards form the Battle Deck and are used in Setup, where
                players work together to build the mission they use for that
                game. Battle Cards are divided into three categories: Objective
                (Blue), Deployment (Red), and Condition (Green).
              </p>
              <p>
                Objective Cards list the objectives the players are trying to
                accomplish, and the Victory conditions used to determine which
                player wins the game.
              </p>
              <p>
                Deployment Cards show a map of the battlefield and the areas in
                which players may deploy their armies during Setup, known as
                deployment zones.
              </p>
              <p>
                Condition Cards have a variety of different effects that impact
                the battle and how the game is played, from limited visibility
                to dangerous minefields!

              <h4>Battle Forces</h4>
              <p>
                In Star Wars: Legion, Battle Forces represent groups of units
                that fought side by side in the Star Wars galaxy. These forces
                are themed around unique sub-groups and can range from a ragtag
                group of Mercenaries to the main invasion force of the Empire.
              </p>
              <p>
                Battle Forces provide players with an alternative way to build
                and field an army. Each Battle Force has its own list of
                specific units that it is allowed to field, its own rank
                requirements for both standard and skirmish armies, and its own
                special rules, which may affect how that Battle Force is built,
                set up, or plays.

                During the Declare Additional Defender step, if a weapon with
                the Beam X keyword is in a unit’s attack pool, that unit may
                declare up to X additional attacks forming attack pools using
                only the weapon with the Beam X keyword, even though the weapon
                has already been added to an attack pool. These additional

                Each additional attack must be against a different defending

                These additional attacks must be in LOS of the attacking unit
                but may be beyond the maximum range of the weapon with the Beam
                X keyword.
              </p>
              <p>

                Some abilities require two objects to be at, within, or beyond a

              </p>
              <p>
                An object is beyond a range of another object if it is entirely
                outside that range as measured by the range tool. For a unit to
                be beyond a range, all miniatures in the unit must be beyond the
                given range.

                A bomb cart miniature is not a unit and cannot gain tokens,

              </p>
              <p>
                A bomb cart has a silhouette that rises from the base of the
                bomb cart miniature up to the handles of the bomb cart. Ignore
                anything placed on the bomb cart when determining its
                silhouette. A bomb cart miniature that obscures non-creature
                troopers with its silhouette provides heavy cover. A bomb cart
                never provides cover to creature troopers or vehicles. A bomb
                cart miniature never blocks LOS.

              <p>
                A bomb cart miniature ignores the effects of difficult terrain
                and can perform partial moves. A bomb cart cannot move through
                impassable terrain.
              </p>
              <p>
                A bomb cart miniature can move through all miniatures, including
                other bomb carts but cannot end its movement overlapping the
                base of another miniature that cannot be displaced. A bomb cart
                miniature’s final position can overlap a trooper miniature’s
                base if that trooper miniature can be displaced, displacing that
                trooper miniature. A bomb cart can reverse.
              </p>
              <p>
                All units can move through bomb cart miniatures but cannot end

                objective tokens used in a game with these objective Battle

                in base contact with an unclaimed objective token in order to

                <strong class="keyword-reference">Claim</strong> action. When a

                claimed side and place it back on the battlefield in the same
                position.
              </p>
              <p>
                The token will remain in base contact with the unit leader as it
                moves around the battlefield. After the unit performs any
                movement, that unit’s controlling player may pick up any claimed

                When a unit leader with a claimed objective token begins its

              <h4>Climb</h4>
              <p>
                Sometimes units maneuver onto tall pieces of obstacle terrain.
                This is accomplished by performing a climb. Miniatures on
                notched bases may not climb.
              </p>
              <p>
                To perform a climb, a unit performs a move as normal, except
                that it must use the speed-1 tool. A miniature may move a
                vertical distance up to height 1 when making a climb and may
                place the movement tool overlapping obstacle terrain that is
                taller than the height of the moving unit’s silhouette.

                standard move. Instead, Sarah performs a climb with the Clone

              <h4>Cohesion</h4>
              <p>
                A unit is in cohesion if all miniatures in that unit are at a
                speed-1 move of the unit leader and within a vertical distance
                equal to the height of the unit leader’s silhouette. For units
                on notched bases, this move may be measured from any part of the
                miniature's base. For more information on silhouettes, see
                <strong class="keyword-reference"
                  ><a href="#line-of-sight">Line of Sight</a></strong
                >. When measuring cohesion, the speed-1 movement tool may not
                overlap a piece of impassable terrain. If a unit is not in
                cohesion for whatever reason, its next action must be a move
                action that ends with all miniatures in cohesion.

              <h4>Command Cards</h4>
              <p>
                Command Cards form a player’s command hand and are used in the
                Command Phase to determine player priority, issue orders to
                units, and grant powerful game effects.
              </p>
              <h5>Building a Command Hand</h5>
              <p>
                Each player prepares a command hand of exactly seven Command
                Cards. A player must include two 1 pip cards, two 2 pip cards,
                and two 3 pip cards, with no duplicates. Additionally, players
                must always include the 4 pip card “Standing Orders."
              </p>
              <p>
                Some Command Cards require certain units. The required unit must
                be in a player’s army for these Command Cards to be included in
                a command hand. Occasionally, a Command Card requires a player
                to be fielding an army from a certain faction or Battle Force to
                be included in the command hand. These restrictions are printed
                on the Command Card.

                <p>
                  The contents of a player’s command hand are secret information
                  and are never shared with their opponent. However, the number
                  of cards in a player’s command hand is not secret, nor is the
                  contents of a player's discard pile. Non-secret information
                  must be freely shared between players at all times.

                their command hand, reveal and resolve their Command Cards,

                this round.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some units have several unique Command Cards, which may only be
                played if that unit is included in a player’s army and is not
                defeated.
              </p>
              <h5>Resolve Command Card Effects</h5>
              <p>
                After both players have played a Command Card facedown, they
                then reveal their Command Cards by flipping them faceup and
                proceed to resolve the effects of the Command Cards. Fully
                resolve the effect of each Command Card before moving to the
                next Command Card. If both players have an effect that occurs at
                the same time, the blue player always resolves their Command
                Card effect first.
              </p>
              <h5>Determine Priority</h5>
              <p>
                Once players have resolved all relevant Command Card effects,
                compare the number of pips on the Command Cards that were played
                this round. The player whose card has the least number of pips
                has priority for the round.
              </p>
              <p>
                If both players reveal Command Cards with the same number of
                pips, one player rolls a red defense die. If the result is a

                  class="game-icon"
                />, that player has priority. On any other result, the other
                player has priority.
              </p>
              <p>
                If one player was unable to play a Command Card due to not

                unit, the other player automatically has priority. If neither
                player played a Command Card, one player rolls a red defense die
                to determine priority.
              </p>
              <h5>Nominate Commanders and Issue Orders</h5>
              <p>
                After determining priority, players nominate commanders and
                issue orders to their units.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the played Command Card corresponds to a specific unit, that
                unit must be nominated as the commander. Otherwise, players may
                nominate any one
                <img
                  src="img/legion-commander-icon.png"
                  alt="Commander Icon"
                  loading="lazy"
                  class="game-icon"
                />
                unit to be their commander.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once all players have nominated a commander, they issue orders
                to their units, starting with the player who has priority. The
                number of orders and the units they can be issued to is listed
                on each Command Card. For a commander to issue an order to a
                unit, a unit must:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Be at range 1–3 of the nominated commander (the nominated
                  commander is always at range 1 of itself).
                </li>
                <li>
                  The unit cannot have already received an order during the
                  current Command Phase.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The unit must match the type (if any) listed on the Command
                  Card.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                When a unit is issued an order, take an order token that
                corresponds to the unit’s rank and place it faceup on the
                battlefield next to the unit. If a commander cannot issue all
                the orders allowed by the Command Card, any excess orders are
                lost. Once both players have issued orders, they then proceed to
                create the order pool.
              </p>
              <div class="callout">
                <h5>Other Ways to Issue Orders</h5>
                <p>
                  Some rules or abilities allow units to be issued orders from
                  sources other than the nominated commander. These units do not
                  have to follow the above criteria when they are issued orders
                  in this way, instead following the rules of the effect
                  granting that order.
                </p>
              </div>

                Nick has played the Command Card Push, which lets him issue
                orders to two units. Nick nominates Obi-Wan Kenobi as his
                commander. Nick can then issue the two orders from Push to two
                units at command range of his chosen commander, which in this
                case is at range 1–3 of Obi-Wan Kenobi. He chooses to issue an
                order to the Clone Trooper unit. For the second order, he cannot
                choose the Clone Trooper unit again, as it already has a faceup
                order token. The Infantry Support Platform is outside of Obi-
                Wan Kenobi’s command range, so it cannot be issued an order.
                Choosing between the AT-RT and Obi-Wan Kenobi, Nick decides to
                issue an order to Obi-Wan Kenobi, who is in command range
                because a miniature is always at range 1 of itself.
              </p>
              <h5>Create the Order Pool</h5>
              <p>
                After issuing orders, each player creates their order pool by
                taking one order token that matches the rank of each undefeated
                unit that was not issued an order and shuffling those order
                tokens together.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once players have created their order pools, the Command Phase
                is over, and the Activation Phase begins.

                      To promote a commander, a player chooses any of their

                      the battlefield and places a commander token next to that

                      A unit promoted to commander is activated using a

                      When a commander is defeated, their commanderspecific

                  If a unit is at range 1–3 of a friendly commander, it may use

                      A courage value of “–” is considered infinite when

              <h4>Contingencies X (Unit Keyword)</h4>
              <p>
                When building a command hand before the game begins, for each
                unit with the Contingencies X keyword in a player’s army, that
                player sets aside up to X additional Command Cards facedown as
                Contingency Cards, where X is equal to the combined
                Contingencies X value on all their units. These set-aside cards
                may have any number of pips but must follow all other rules for
                constructing a command hand. Set-aside Contingency Cards are not
                considered to be in a player’s command hand and are kept secret
                from an opponent. A player may look at their set-aside
                Contingency Cards at any time.
              </p>
              <p>
                After a player reveals a Command Card, before any other effects
                are resolved, that player may discard that card to reveal one of
                their set-aside Contingency Cards with an equal number of pips
                instead. The revealed Contingency Card is then treated as that
                player’s selected and revealed Command Card for that turn. If
                both players have set-aside Contingency Cards, the blue player
                must decide first whether or not to reveal a Contingency Card.
              </p>
              <p>
                If all a player’s units with the Contingencies X keyword are
                defeated, a player cannot reveal or use their Contingency Cards.

                Some units are faithful companions or subservient minions and
                are almost never seen apart from another unit. A unit like this
                has the Counterpart keyword and the miniature that represents
                this unit is always added to another unit. That miniature has a
                Counterpart Card and their miniature is a counterpart miniature.
                The combined unit has the rank, unit type, defense die, courage
                value, surge conversion chart, and speed as shown on the Unit
                Card.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Sometimes, a Counterpart Card has a different unit type only
                  for the purposes of equipping Upgrade Cards.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When assigning wounds to a combined unit, any miniature can be
                  assigned wounds by the controlling player, but counterpart
                  miniatures must be defeated first.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Upgrade Cards without weapons equipped to a counterpart
                  miniature are usable by the rest of the unit, unless the
                  counterpart miniature is defeated.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Upgrade Cards with weapons are usable only by the miniature
                  which has them equipped.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The non-counterpart miniatures in the unit use the wound
                  threshold on the Unit Card, the counterpart miniature uses the
                  wound threshold on the Counterpart Card.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The combined unit has the keywords on both the Unit Card and
                  the Counterpart Card.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Miniatures in a combined unit may only use weapons that are on
                  their respective cards. If a combined unit gains a weapon from
                  a Command Card, only the non-counterpart miniature may use it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the counterpart miniature is defeated, the unit loses any
                  keywords, abilities, or effects on the Counterpart Card.

              <p>
                Trooper units have a courage value on their Unit Card. When a
                unit has a number of suppression tokens equal to or greater than
                its courage value, it is suppressed. If a unit has a number of
                suppression tokens that is equal to or greater than double its
                courage value, it is panicked. A suppressed unit performs one
                less action each activation, while a panicked unit cannot
                perform actions, including free actions. For more information on
                the effects of suppression, see

            <a href="#a" class="entry-close"></a>
            <div class="entry-dialog">
              <img class="btn-back" src="img/legion-exhaust.png" />
              <h4>Cover</h4>
              <img
                src="img/cover.jpg"
                class="example-photo"

              />
              <p>
                Cover helps miniatures defend themselves from attacks. Cover is
                divided into three categories: light, heavy, and no cover, and
                is determined during the attack sequence. Some rules refer to
                cover having a numerical value that is improved or reduced—
                light cover has a value of 1, heavy cover has a value of 2, and
                no cover has a value of 0. The numerical value of cover cannot
                be increased above 2 for any reason. Resolve effects that
                improve cover before effects that reduce cover.
              </p>

              <h5>Apply Dodge and Cover</h5>
              <p>
                If at least half of the miniatures in the defending unit are
                obscured, the defending unit has cover. The type of cover is
                determined by whatever is obscuring the defending unit,
                providing either heavy or light cover based on the players’
                discussion of terrain before the game. If miniatures in the
                defending unit are obscured by terrain that provides light cover
                and some by terrain that provides heavy cover, if more than half
                of the obscured miniatures are obscured by terrain that provides
                heavy cover, the defending unit has heavy cover. Otherwise, the
                unit has light cover.
              </p>
              <p>
                A unit with one or more suppression tokens improves its cover by
                one: a unit with no cover gains light cover, and a unit in light
                cover gains heavy cover.
              </p>
              <p>

              </p>
              <h5>Terrain Providing Cover</h5>
              <p>
                The main purpose of terrain is to block line of sight between
                miniatures and provide them with cover. Terrain provides either
                light, heavy, or no cover. What kind of cover, if any, a piece
                of terrain provides is ultimately for players to decide. Before
                the game begins, players should agree on what kind of cover each
                piece of terrain on the battlefield provides.

              <h4>Defeated</h4>
              <p>
                A miniature is defeated when it has a number of wound tokens
                assigned to it equal to its wound threshold. If there are
                unassigned wounds remaining after a miniature has been defeated,
                the player chooses another miniature from the same unit and
                repeats the process until either all wounds have been assigned
                or all miniatures in the unit have been defeated. When a unit
                suffers wounds from an attack, if the attacker has LOS to only
                some of the miniatures in the defending unit, the defending unit
                cannot suffer wounds greater than the total wound threshold of
                miniatures that are in LOS.
              </p>
              <p>
                When a miniature is defeated, remove it from the battlefield. If
                a unit leader is defeated and there are still undefeated
                miniatures in the unit, the unit’s controlling player must
                immediately choose another miniature in that unit to become the
                unit leader, replacing that miniature with the unit leader
                miniature.
              </p>

              <p>
                When all of the miniatures in a unit are defeated, the unit is
                defeated. Remove all order tokens for that unit from the
                battlefield.
              </p>

                <h5>Removing Miniatures in Melee</h5>
                <p>
                  When miniatures in melee are defeated, space may be created
                  for the attacking miniatures to advance. After the attack is
                  resolved, starting with the attacking player, each player must
                  place any friendly miniatures that are no longer in base
                  contact with miniatures in the enemy unit into base contact
                  with the enemy unit. The rules of cohesion must still be
                  followed during these placements.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If, for any reason, miniatures cannot be placed back into base
                  contact with an enemy miniature and none of the miniatures
                  belonging to that unit are in base contact with an enemy
                  miniature, those miniatures do not move and that unit is no
                  longer in melee.

              <h5>Example: Assigning Wounds and Defeating Miniatures</h5>
              <p class="example-text">
                After comparing results, Dallas’ unit of five Clone Troopers has
                suffered three wounds from an attack. He then assigns one of the
                wounds to a miniature in the unit. Since all the miniatures in
                the Clone Trooper unit have a wound threshold of 1, the
                miniature that Dallas assigned a wound to is defeated. Since
                there are two unassigned wounds remaining, Dallas chooses
                another miniature from the same unit and repeats the process
                until either all wounds have been suffered or all miniatures in
                the unit have been defeated. Since each Clone Trooper only has a
                wound threshold of 1 and the unit suffered three wounds, this
                means that three Clone Troopers are defeated, leaving two Clone
                Troopers remaining.
              </p>
              <p class="example-text">
                After comparing results, Chris’ unit of three unwounded Wookiees
                has suffered four wounds. He then assigns one of the wounds to a
                miniature in the unit. Because Wookiees have a wound threshold
                of 3, the Wookiee is not defeated when it is assigned the wound,
                and Chris has three more wounds left to assign. However, because
                the Wookiee has at least one wound token assigned to it, it is
                wounded, and Chris MUST choose to assign it any additional wound
                tokens since it has more wound tokens assigned to it than any
                other miniature in the unit. Chris is forced to assign the next
                two wounds to the Wookiee until it reaches its wound threshold
                of 3 and is defeated, leaving one wound left to be assigned.
                Chris must choose a non-unit leader Wookiee to assign the wound
                to. In the future, because the wounded Wookiee has more wound
                tokens than the other, Chris must assign wounds to it first, and
                must continue to do so until it is defeated.

                  When a miniature added by an Upgrade Card is defeated, the

              <h4>Defining the Battlefield</h4>
              <p>
                Players work together to define the battlefield and determine
                the mission they will use for their game of Star Wars: Legion.
                Using the blue player’s Battle Deck, separate the Objective,
                Deployment, and Condition Cards into three facedown piles and
                shuffle each pile, orienting them so they are faceup to the blue
                player. Then, draw four cards from each category, placing them
                faceup in a horizontal row left to right in the order they were
                drawn, with each category in its own row. The order of the rows
                does not matter, only that each category is placed in its own
                horizontal row. Once all cards have been drawn, players should
                have a 4x3 grid of cards as shown.
              </p>
              <img
                src="img/defining-battlefield.PNG"
                class="example-photo"
                alt="example battle card grid"
                loading="lazy"
              />
              <p>
                Once the grid has been laid out, players define the battlefield.
                Starting with the blue player, players take turns choosing a
                category and eliminating the leftmost card in that row. A player
                may also decide to not eliminate a card if they do not want to.
                If players eliminate the first three cards in a row, they cannot
                eliminate the final card. After each player has had two chances
                to eliminate a card, the leftmost card remaining in each row is
                the card that is used during that game.
              </p>
              <p>
                Next, players resolve any Setup instructions on the Objective
                Card, then resolve any Setup instructions on the Condition Card.
              </p>
              <h5>Example: Defining the Battlefield</h5>
              <p class="example-text">
                Matt and Andrew have determined that Matt will be the blue
                player and Andrew will be the red player. Using Matt’s Battle
                Deck, they separate the Objective, Deployment, and Condition
                Cards into three separate facedown piles, shuffling each. Then
                they draw four cards from each category, placing each category
                horizontally in a row. Starting with Matt, he and Andrew take
                turns choosing a row and eliminating the leftmost card in that
                row. Matt chooses the Objective row, and the leftmost card is
                eliminated. Andrew then chooses Conditions, and the leftmost
                card is eliminated. Matt then chooses to eliminate the leftmost
                card in the Deployment row. Content with how things are, Andrew
                decides to not eliminate any more cards. The leftmost cards in
                each row are the Battle Cards that Matt and Andrew will use for
                their game.

              <h4>Deflect (Unit Keyword)</h4>
              <p>
                When a unit that has the Deflect keyword is defending against a
                ranged attack, if it spends any dodge tokens during the Apply
                Dodge and Cover step, its surge conversion chart gains

                result rolled by the defender during the Roll Defense Dice step.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is possible for the attacking unit to be defeated by a
                defending unit using the Deflect keyword. If the Deflect keyword
                causes the attacking unit to be defeated, the attack continues,
                and the defender can still suffer wounds.

              <h4>Deploy Units</h4>
              <p>
                After resolving any Setup rules on the Objective and Condition
                Cards, players then resolve any Setup rules on the Deployment
                Cards. Then, starting with the blue player, players alternate,
                placing one unit from their army within their respective
                deployment zones as shown on the Deployment Card. Players
                continue taking turns placing units until all units have been
                deployed. When deploying a unit with multiple miniatures, all
                miniatures must be placed in cohesion with their unit leader.
              </p>
              <p>
                A unit is in cohesion if all miniatures in that unit are at a
                speed-1 move of the unit leader and within a vertical distance
                equal to the height of the unit leader’s silhouette. For units
                on notched bases, this move may be measured from any part of the
                miniature's base. For more information on silhouettes, see
                <strong class="keyword-reference"
                  ><a href="#line-of-sight">Line of Sight</a></strong
                >. When measuring cohesion, the speed-1 movement tool may not
                overlap a piece of impassable terrain. If a unit is not in
                cohesion for whatever reason, its next action must be a move
                action that ends with all miniatures in cohesion.
              </p>
              <p>
                During deployment, a unit may not be placed in base contact with
                an enemy unit, nor may it move into base contact with an enemy
                unit.
              </p>
              <h5>Deploying Oblong Bases</h5>
              <p>
                Some miniatures have oblong bases instead of round bases.
                Miniatures with oblong bases may extend beyond the boundary of a
                player’s deployment zone so long as its base is touching an edge
                of the battlefield within that deployment zone and at least half
                of the base is inside the boundary of the deployment zone.
              </p>
              <p>
                After deployment is complete, one player takes the round counter
                and sets it to “1." The game of Star Wars: Legion is ready to
                begin!

              <h4>Detachment: Unit Name/Type (Unit Keyword)</h4>
              <p>
                A unit with the Detachment keyword is subject to several
                restrictions during Army Building and Setup. During Army
                Building, a unit with the Detachment keyword can only be
                included in a player’s army if a unit that has the unit name or
                unit type specified is also included in that army. Each unit
                with the Detachment keyword needs its own matching unit with the
                specified unit name or unit type.
              </p>
              <p class="example-text">
                For example, a player wishes to add a DF-90 Mortar Trooper to
                their army. Because the DF-90 Mortar Trooper has the Detachment:
                Shoretroopers keyword, the player must first add a unit of
                Shoretroopers to their army before adding the DF-90 Mortar
                Trooper. The player does so, and the army now contains a
                Shoretroopers unit and a DF-90 Mortar Trooper unit. The player
                then wishes to add a second DF-90 Mortar Trooper unit to their
                army, and therefore must first select a second unit of
                Shoretroopers to include in their army.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the Deploy Units step of Setup, the unit leader of the
                unit with the Detachment keyword must be placed at speed-1 and
                within height 1 of a unit leader from a friendly unit that has
                the unit name or unit type specified. When deploying multiple
                units with the same Detachment keyword, each unit must be
                deployed at speed-1 and within height 1 of a different unit
                leader. When a unit deploys using the Detachment keyword, it
                does not have to be deployed within its deployment zone.
              </p>
              <p>
                If a unit with the Detachment keyword cannot be deployed
                following the Detachment rules, it is deployed as normal in a
                player’s deployment zone. However, if a player has a unit with
                the name or type specified that has not yet been deployed, that
                unit must be deployed before a unit with the Detachment keyword
                is deployed.
              </p>

                When a token detonates, perform a separate attack against each

                using the area weapon, surge conversion chart, and weapon

                attacks, meaning that it cannot spend aim tokens or modify
                attack dice, regardless of any abilities on the unit that placed
                the token. After a token detonates, remove it from the

              <h4>Detonate X: Charge Type (Weapon Keyword)</h4>
              <p>
                After a unit controlled by any player attacks, moves, or
                performs an action, each unit that has a weapon with the
                Detonate X keyword may detonate up to X friendly charge tokens

                a unit moves or performs an action, with the exception of
                spending a standby token which can be spent by a unit before the
                token detonates. If both players have units that could detonate
                charge tokens, the player that does not control the unit that
                just performed the attack, move, or action may use their unit’s
                Detonate X keyword first.

              <h4>Difficult Terrain</h4>
              <p>
                Difficult terrain restricts but does not completely prevent
                movement. Craters, barricades, ruins, woods, piles of rubble,
                and swamps are all examples of difficult terrain. Difficult
                terrain reduces the maximum speed of a unit moving through or
                into it by 1 to a minimum of 1.

              <h4>Displacement</h4>
              <p>
                Some miniatures with notched bases can force other miniatures to
                move out of their way, usually due to their large physical size.
                This is called displacement. Only certain unit types may
                displace other miniatures.
              </p>
              <p>
                When a miniature that can displace moves during any movement, if
                at any point its base would overlap any trooper miniatures,
                those miniatures are displaced. Trooper units that are engaged
                cannot be displaced and, therefore, cannot be moved through.
              </p>
              <p>When a unit is displaced:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Set Aside Miniatures:</strong> Place displaced
                  miniatures to the side of the battlefield. If a unit leader is
                  displaced, mark its position.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Move:</strong> The miniature that displaced the
                  trooper miniatures continues its move as normal, unimpeded by
                  the miniatures it displaced.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Place Displaced Miniatures:</strong> The opponent of
                  the player controlling the displacing unit places all the
                  displaced unit leaders back on the battlefield at a speed-1
                  move from their original positions, or as close as possible to
                  if unable. Miniatures cannot be placed in base contact with an
                  enemy miniature. Place all remaining displaced miniatures and
                  any miniatures that are out of cohesion in cohesion with their
                  respective unit leaders. Miniatures cannot be placed in base
                  contact with an enemy miniature.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Gain Suppression Token:</strong> Each unit that had at
                  least one miniature displaced gains a suppression token. A
                  unit may only gain one suppression token from displacement per
                  activation, even if it is displaced multiple times.

                Josh’s AT-RT is performing a standard move and he determines
                that the AT-RT would displace Dallas’ Battle Droid unit. Josh
                determines that four out of the six Battle Droids are displaced,
                including the Battle Droid’s unit leader. Josh picks up the
                displaced Battle Droids and places them to the side temporarily,
                marking the unit leader’s position. Then Josh’s AT-RT continues
                its movement as normal. Dallas then takes the displaced unit
                leader and places it on the battlefield within a speed-1 move of
                its original position. Dallas then places the rest of the
                displaced Battle Droids in cohesion. Since some of the Battle
                Droids are no longer in cohesion with the unit leader (due to
                them being displaced), Dallas places those miniatures in
                cohesion. Finally, the Battle Droids receive a suppression
                token.

              <h4>Distract (Unit Keyword)</h4>
              <p>
                As a free card action, a unit with the Distract keyword can
                choose an enemy trooper unit at range 1–2 and in LOS. Until the
                end of the round, when the chosen enemy unit performs an attack,
                it must attack the unit that used the Distract action, if able.
              </p>
              <p>
                While the chosen enemy unit is attacking the unit with the
                Distract keyword, each miniature in the enemy unit must choose
                an eligible weapon to contribute to an attack pool. The enemy
                unit may only declare additional defenders and form additional
                dice pools if after first forming a dice pool with eligible
                weapons, there are still weapons usable by miniatures in the
                unit that were not eligible to be added to the first attack
                pool.
              </p>
              <p>
                When a unit uses the Distract keyword, if it had the
                Inconspicuous keyword, it loses it until the end of the round.

              <p>
                Some Command Cards have the Divulge keyword. Command Cards that
                contain the Divulge keyword are divided by a horizontal line,
                which serves to visually separate the Divulge keyword effect
                from the normal Command Card effect. Some Divulge cards have
                multiple options, in this case the player must pick one. These
                cards can be revealed at the start of the phase or step
                indicated by the Divulge keyword. If a card is revealed in this
                manner, resolve the text that follows the Divulge keyword.
              </p>
              <p>
                A card that is revealed in this way is not played and is
                returned to that player’s command hand at the end of the step in
                which it was divulged. Players can divulge as many Command Cards
                as they wish. If both players have Command Cards that are
                divulged at the same time, the blue player can reveal their
                Command Card first. If this opportunity is declined, that card
                can no longer be divulged.

                Some Upgrade Cards are dual-sided. When building an army, only
                count the points cost on one of the sides of the card. When a

                controlling player decides which side is faceup. Only the rules

              <h4>Embark and Disembark</h4>
              <p>
                Embarking and disembarking are movements that allow a unit to
                enter or exit a vehicle with the Transport X or Light Transport
                X keyword. A unit may not embark and disembark in the same
                activation.
              </p>
              <p>
                A trooper unit may make a speed-1 embark or disembark move
                during a move action instead of making another movement. Units
                with speed 0, the Stationary keyword, a claimed objective token,
                or the creature trooper unit type cannot embark or disembark.
              </p>
              <p>
                To embark on a vehicle with the Transport X: Open keyword, a
                unit must end an embark move with their unit leader in base
                contact with the vehicle. To embark on a vehicle with the
                Transport X: Closed keyword, a unit must end an embark move with
                their unit leader in base contact with the vehicle, then
                sacrifice an action to embark on the vehicle. A unit that cannot
                spend an action after making an embark move may not embark on a
                vehicle with the Transport X: Closed keyword. After successfully
                embarking, the unit is removed from the battlefield and a pair
                of matching ID tokens are placed next to the vehicle and
                embarked Unit Card.
              </p>
              <p>
                To disembark, a unit that is being transported may perform a
                disembark move during a move action instead of making another
                movement. When a unit performs a disembark move, place its unit
                leader in base contact with the vehicle, then place the other
                miniatures in cohesion. A unit performing the disembark move may
                not be placed into base contact with enemy units. After all
                miniatures in the unit are placed, perform a speed-1 move with
                the unit. A unit may not move into base contact with an enemy
                unit during this movement. When a unit disembarks, if the
                vehicle that is transporting that unit has performed more than
                one non-pivot move during the current round, disembarking uses
                all of its available actions, and it cannot perform additional
                actions or any free actions.

                are considered enemy units to that player.

              <h4>Entourage: Unit Name (Unit Keyword)</h4>
              <p>
                During Army Building, if a player includes a unit with the
                Entourage keyword, one unit specified by the Entourage keyword
                does not count its rank towards the maximum rank requirements
                for that rank. This can allow a player to bring more units of a
                specific rank than rank requirements allow.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the Command Phase, during the Issue Orders step, a unit with
                the Entourage keyword may issue an order to a friendly unit at
                range 1–2 that has the name specified by the Entourage keyword.
              </p>
              <p class="example-text">
                For example, Director Orson Krennic has Entourage: Death
                Troopers. If an army includes Director Orson Krennic, one unit
                of Death Troopers in the same army does not count towards the
                maximum number of special forces ranks allowed in the army,
                allowing a player to bring up to three other special forces
                units in addition to the Death Troopers. In the Command Phase,
                Director Orson Krennic may issue an order to a Death Trooper
                unit at range 1–2.

                Most Upgrade Cards provide a static game effect, but some cards

                When a card is exhausted, turn the card 90° to the right so that
                it is sideways. Exhausted cards may not be used until they are

              <p>
                When a unit recovers, it readies all of its exhausted cards.

                Units in <em>Star Wars</em>: Legion are grouped together in
                factions: the Galactic Empire (Empire), the Rebel Alliance
                (Rebel), the Separatist Alliance (Separatist), and the Galactic
                Republic (Republic). A unit’s faction is shown by the faction
                icon printed in the top left corner of its Unit Card. All units
                in an army must share the same faction, unless otherwise
                specified by a special rule.
              </p>
              <p>
                Occasionally a rule references the Light Side or the Dark Side.
                The Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Republic are the Light Side,
                and the Galactic Empire and the Separatist Alliance are the Dark
                Side. Armies not built using these factions state what upgrades
                units may choose in their rules text.

                The unit the Flaw Card belongs to is indicated in the top right
                corner of the Flaw Card. An opponent may play a Flaw Card from
                their command hand when permitted by the rules on the Flaw Card.
                If both players have a Flaw Card in their command hand, at the
                start of each phase the player with priority must decide first
                whether to play a Flaw Card or not. If neither player has
                priority, then the blue player decides first. Any played Flaw
                Cards are discarded at the start of the End Phase and their

                actions do not cost the unit any actions to perform. Free card
                actions have this symbol
                <img src="/img/legion-free-action.png" class="game-icon" />. A
                unit may perform more than one free card action, as long as they
                are different. A unit may only perform free actions during its
                Perform Actions step and may only perform each instance of a
                free action once per activation. Free actions do not allow a
                unit to perform a non-move action more than once during its
                activation.

                Rules in Star Wars: Legion often use the terms friendly and

                friendly to that player. Units that a player does not control
                are considered enemy units to that player.

                A graffiti token represents a striking image or symbol painted
                onto the terrain of the battlefield. Graffiti tokens affect a
                unit’s morale. Graffiti tokens have two sides. Players should
                place the graffiti token flat on a surface so that the side that
                corresponds to their player color is faceup.

                During the Rally step of a unit’s activation, it may roll one
                additional die if it has LOS to and is at range 1–2 of a
                graffiti token placed by a friendly miniature. It must roll one
                fewer die, to a minimum of 1, if it has LOS and is at range 1–2
                of a graffiti token placed by an enemy miniature.
              </p>
              <p>
                Graffiti tokens remain in play until the end of the game. Units

              <h4>Terrain Height</h4>
              <p>
                Each piece of terrain has a height characteristic. To measure
                this, take the range tool and put one end on the battlefield,
                orienting the range tool vertically. Then add segments until the
                end of the range tool is taller than the piece of terrain. The
                segment of the range tool that the top of the terrain is inside
                is equal to that object’s height.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some terrain might have various pieces at multiple heights. When
                determining the height of the terrain for the purposes of
                performing a movement or a climb, measure the height of the part
                of the terrain the miniatures are moving or climbing to,
                subtracting the height of any terrain the miniatures may be on.

                Sarah wants to measure the height of this building to determine

                she takes the range tool and places one end on the battlefield,
                holding the range tool upright. Because the roof of the building
                is entirely inside the first segment of the range tool, the
                building is considered height 1.

                Later in the game, Sarah measures the height of another

                of different heights. One roof is completely inside the first
                segment of the range tool, so that part of the building is
                height 1. However, the second roof of the building is inside the
                second segment of the range tool, so that part of the building
                is height 2.

              <h4>Hover: Ground/Air X (Unit Keyword)</h4>
              <p>
                A unit with the Hover: Ground or Hover: Air X keyword may
                perform standby actions during the Perform Actions step and may
                perform reverse moves.
              </p>
              <p>
                A unit with the Hover: Ground keyword is treated as a ground
                vehicle by other units for some rules purposes, such as
                obscuring miniatures and determining cover, moving through other
                units, and displacement. For all other game effects, the unit is
                still treated as a repulsor vehicle.
              </p>
              <p>
                A unit with the Hover: Air X keyword ignores terrain of height X
                or lower while moving and may end a movement overlapping such
                terrain.
              </p>
              <h5>Strafe</h5>
              <p>
                If the unit with the Hover: Ground/Air X keyword has a base with
                side notches, the unit may perform a strafe move as part of a
                movement action instead of moving normally. A unit reduces its
                maximum speed by 1 to a minimum of 1 while performing a strafe.
                As with other movements with notched bases, a strafe can be a
                full strafe or a partial strafe, and can be interrupted if an
                object prevents the strafing miniature from fully progressing
                across the movement tool.
              </p>
              <p>
                To perform a full strafe, place the end of a movement tool into
                one of the side notches on the unit’s base. Keeping the movement
                tool in place on the battlefield, move the miniature along the
                movement tool until the opposite side notch is wholly in the
                opposite end of the movement tool. While performing a strafe, a
                miniature’s base must not overlap terrain or units that it
                cannot move through.
              </p>

                A unit that has the Jump X keyword can perform the Jump X card
                action any time it could perform a move action. The unit
                performs a move action as normal and can ignore or end its
                movement on top of terrain that is height X or lower. While
                performing a move with the Jump X action, a unit ignores the
                effects of difficult terrain and other miniatures with a height
                equal to or lower than X. When a unit performs the Jump X
                action, measure height from that unit’s starting position.

              <h4>Keywords</h4>
              <p>
                Bolded words are special rules called keywords. There are four
                types of keywords: command, unit, upgrade, and weapon. Their
                full rules text
                <em>[can be found in the entries on this website]</em>
              </p>
              <div class="callout">
                <p>
                  Some keywords have a numerical value, presented as "X" in the
                  Keyword Glossary. These keywords stack with themselves and can
                  be any type of keyword. If a unit gains multiple instances of
                  a keyword with a numerical value, add those values together.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For example, Stormtroopers have the Precise 1 keyword on their
                  Unit Card. If they equip the Targeting Scopes gear upgrade,
                  which gives them Precise 1, they will have Precise 2.

                when a unit with a notched base moves along the movement tool.
                If this is not possible, the miniature stops its movement when
                it contacts the edge of the battlefield, then it loses any
                remaining actions and may not perform any free actions.

              <h4>Line of Sight</h4>
              <p>
                Line of sight (LOS) is used to see if one miniature can “see”
                another miniature. A player determines LOS from the perspective
                of their miniatures. This is done by creating a cylinder rising
                from the miniature’s base called a silhouette. A miniature’s
                silhouette includes the miniature’s base and the area above it
                up to the height of the silhouette. When determining LOS between
                two miniatures, if an unobstructed straight imaginary line can
                be drawn from any part of one miniature’s silhouette to any part
                of the other miniature’s silhouette, those miniatures have LOS
                to each other.
              </p>
              <p>
                To determine the height of a miniature’s silhouette, use the
                following rules:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Trooper units and all their subtypes use a standardized
                  silhouette template to determine LOS. Place the side with the
                  white mark touching the miniature’s base, moving the template
                  around if needed. Miniatures in trooper units with small bases
                  use the small base trooper silhouette template, and miniatures
                  in trooper units with notched bases use the notched base
                  trooper silhouette template.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Unlike trooper units, vehicles do not use silhouette templates
                  when determining LOS. To determine a vehicles silhouette,
                  create a cylinder rising from the vehicle miniature’s base all
                  the way to the top of the vehicle’s hull— do not include
                  things like antennas, weapons, or crew members when creating
                  this cylinder. Players should discuss vehicle silhouettes
                  before the game begins.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Blocking LOS</h5>
              <p>
                Regardless of which silhouettes are used to determine LOS,
                several things may block LOS by preventing an imaginary straight
                line from being drawn between the silhouettes of the two
                miniatures:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The silhouettes of miniatures in vehicle units block LOS.
                </li>
                <li>Terrain that the players have determined blocks LOS.</li>
                <li>
                  The silhouettes of miniatures in trooper units and all their
                  subtypes <strong>do not</strong> block LOS.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Terrain Blocking LOS</h5>
              <p>
                Terrain can block LOS between miniatures by preventing an
                unobstructed imaginary straight line from being drawn between
                their silhouettes. This usually is due to the terrain’s size or
                shape creating a barrier between the two silhouettes.
                Additionally, some terrain also blocks LOS due to its nature of
                being concealing or obscuring—an example of this would be a
                billowing smokestack, a foggy marsh, or a burning ruin. Terrain
                like this should be identified by the players before the game
                begins.

                silhouettes.

              <p class="example-text">

              <h4>Loadout (Unit Keyword)</h4>
              <p>
                During Army Building, when a player includes a unit with the
                Loadout keyword in their army, for each Upgrade Card equipped to
                that unit, they may choose another eligible Upgrade Card of the
                same type with an equal or lesser points cost and set it aside.
                When the unit with the Loadout keyword deploys during the Deploy
                Units step, it may swap any number of its equipped Upgrade Cards
                with the matching set-aside Upgrade Cards one for one.
              </p>
              <p>
                When swapping Upgrade Cards, a unit cannot have two or more
                upgrades with the same name equipped at the same time. If two or
                more units with the Loadout keyword are in the same army, keep
                their respective set-aside Upgrade Cards separate. Each unit can
                swap Upgrade Cards only with their own setaside cards; they
                cannot share set-aside Upgrade Cards.
              </p>
              <p>
                A Counterpart Card that is added to a unit with the Loadout
                keyword also benefits from the Loadout ability.

                Star Wars: Legion uses two kinds of measuring tools: movement
                tools and range tools. Any distance that is measured using a
                measurement tool can be measured at any time, but players may
                only use one movement tool and a range tool with up to five
                segments.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are three movement tools, from shortest to longest: the
                speed-1 tool, the speed-2 tool, and the speed-3 tool.

                Sometimes, more than one number is shown—in this case, the first
                number represents the minimum range, and the second number
                represents the maximum range. If only a single number is shown,
                then that is the maximum range for that effect.

              <p>
                Range is always measured as the shortest distance possible
                between two objects. To measure range between two objects, take
                the range tool and place it flat on the battlefield so that one
                end is touching the object being measured from. Then add
                segments until the total length of the range tool is longer than
                the distance between the two objects. The segment of the range
                tool that object is inside is equal to the range between the two
                objects. When measuring to or from miniatures, always measure
                from the miniature’s base, ignoring the miniature itself.
              </p>
              <p>
                Melee range is not measured with the range tool; instead, two
                miniatures are in melee range with one another if they are in
                base contact.
              </p>
              <h5>Example: Measuring</h5>
              <p>
                When measuring range between two objects, only take the
                horizontal distance into account—never the vertical distance. A
                measurement tool should always be flat on the battlefield; if
                this isn’t possible (due to terrain, for example), hold the
                measuring tool above the battlefield and check positions based
                on the measurement tool.

              <h5>At, Within, and Beyond</h5>
              <p>
                Some abilities require two objects to be at, within, or beyond a
                certain distance from each other.
              </p>
              <p>
                An object is at a range of another object if any portion of it
                is inside that range as measured by the range tool. For a unit
                to be at a specified range, only one miniature in the unit must
                be at the given range. An object is always at any range of
                itself.
              </p>
              <p>
                An object is within a range of another object if it is entirely
                inside that range as measured by the range tool. For a unit to
                be within a range, all miniatures in the unit must be within the
                given range. A unit that is within a certain range is also at
                that range.
              </p>
              <p>
                An object is beyond a range of another object if it is entirely
                outside that range as measured by the range tool. For a unit to
                be beyond a range, all miniatures in the unit must be beyond the
                given range.

                  <img class="game-icon" src="img/legion-force.png" /> Upgrade
                  Card equipped, measure the range of any effects on the card

                The Clone Trooper unit is at range 1 of Obi-Wan Kenobi because
                it has at least one miniature whose base is at least partially
                inside the first segment of the range tool. The AT-RT is within
                range 1 of Obi-Wan Kenobi because its base is entirely inside
                the first segment of the range tool. The B1 Battle Droids are
                beyond range 1 of Obi-Wan Kenobi because all of their
                miniatures' bases are entirely outside the first segment of the
                range tool.
              </p>
              <h5>Terrain Height</h5>
              <p>
                Each piece of terrain has a height characteristic. To measure
                this, take the range tool and put one end on the battlefield,
                orienting the range tool vertically. Then add segments until the
                end of the range tool is taller than the piece of terrain. The
                segment of the range tool that the top of the terrain is inside
                is equal to that object’s height.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some terrain might have various pieces at multiple heights. When
                determining the height of the terrain for the purposes of
                performing a movement or a climb, measure the height of the part
                of the terrain the miniatures are moving or climbing to,
                subtracting the height of any terrain the miniatures may be on.

                Sarah wants to measure the height of this building to determine
                how it will impede the movement of her Clone Troopers. To do so,
                she takes the range tool and places one end on the battlefield,
                holding the range tool upright. Because the roof of the building
                is entirely inside the first segment of the range tool, the
                building is considered height 1.
              </p>
              <p class="example-text">
                Later in the game, Sarah measures the height of another
                building. Because this building has multiple levels, it consists
                of different heights. One roof is completely inside the first
                segment of the range tool, so that part of the building is
                height 1. However, the second roof of the building is inside the
                second segment of the range tool, so that part of the building

              <h4>Melee</h4>
              <p>
                Melee is close ranged, hand-to-hand combat between two or more
                units. When two miniatures controlled by opposing players are in
                base contact, those units are in melee.
              </p>
              <h5>Moving Into Melee</h5>
              <p>
                A unit that has at least one weapon with a melee range can start
                a melee by moving into base contact with an enemy miniature.
              </p>
              <p>
                First, move the unit’s unit leader into base contact with an
                enemy miniature. Then, ensuring that all miniatures remain in
                cohesion, place the other miniatures in the unit into base
                contact with enemy miniatures in the unit that their unit leader
                is now in melee with. If any miniatures cannot be placed in base
                contact with enemy miniatures, they must still be placed in
                cohesion. Finally, if the opponent’s unit has at least one
                miniature with a melee weapon, then the opposing player moves
                all of their own miniatures in the unit that are not currently
                in base contact with an enemy miniature into base contact with
                miniatures from the enemy unit that started the melee. The unit
                must mainatin cohesion during these movements.
              </p>
              <p>
                Miniatures may never move or be placed in such a way that they
                would be in base contact with multiple enemy units, though it is
                possible for a unit to be in melee with multiple enemy units if
                another unit joins the melee later. When moving miniatures into
                base contact with enemy miniatures after a melee has been
                started, if there is not space to place a miniature in base
                contact with an enemy miniature in the same melee, that
                miniature must still be placed in cohesion.
              </p>

                Will decides that he wants to move his Clone Trooper unit into
                melee with Tony’s Battle Droids. Because they have a melee
                weapon, the Clone Troopers may move into base contact with the
                Battle Droids. To do this, Will performs a move with the Clone
                Troopers’ unit leader that ends with the Clone Troopers’ unit
                leader in base contact with one of the Battle Droids. Then,
                ensuring that all of the Clone Troopers remain in cohesion, Will
                places the rest of the Clone Troopers so that they are also in
                base contact with the Battle Droids. Because the Battle Droids
                have a melee weapon, Tony places the Battle Droids that are not
                in base contact into base contact with Will’s Clone Troopers
                while maintaining cohesion. The Clone Troopers and Battle Droids
                are engaged and in melee.
              </p>
              <h5>Engaged</h5>
              <p>
                When two or more trooper units are in melee with one another,
                those units are engaged. Only trooper units can be engaged. An
                engaged unit cannot perform moves, form attack pools containing
                ranged weapons, and cannot be targeted by attack pools
                containing ranged weapons.
              </p>
              <h5>Withdraw</h5>
              <p>
                An engaged unit may leave melee during its activation by
                withdrawing. To withdraw, a unit must spend all its available
                actions and can perform no other actions that activation. Then
                it performs a speed-1 move action, ignoring any units it is in
                melee with. A unit with a maximum speed of 0 cannot withdraw. A
                unit cannot end a withdraw move action in melee.
              </p>

                A weapon with a melee range is a melee weapon, and a weapon with
                a blue range icon is a ranged weapon. A weapon with both a melee
                icon and one or more blue ranged icons can be used as a melee
                weapon or a ranged weapon, chosen when the weapon is added to an
                attack pool—treat the weapon as that type for the duration of
                the attack sequence.

                An attack pool that contains melee weapons is a melee attack,

                The <em>Star Wars</em> galaxy is populated with all manner of
                heroes, villains, rogues, organizations, and even entire forces
                unaligned with the galaxy’s major power structures. These
                characters and forces appear in <em>Star Wars</em>: Legion as
                Mercenary units.
              </p>
              <p>
                Mercenary units are not loyal to any of the game’s factions.
                However, factions and some Battle Forces can hire certain
                Mercenary units and field them in their armies. The Unit Card of
                a Mercenary unit indicates each faction that can include that
                Mercenary unit in an army. There is no additional cost to
                fielding a Mercenary unit in an army.

                Mercenary units do not count toward the minimum number of ranks
                required in an army, but they do count toward the maximum ranks
                allowed. An army may include only two Mercenary units of the

                For example, a standard Galactic Empire army that includes one

                A player cannot normally field an army that contains only
                Mercenary units, but some Battle Forces allow a player to do
                just that. These Battle Forces have their own unique
                requirements and rules. Some Mercenary units cannot be used by
                any faction; these units can only be used when special rules
                allow them to be included in armies.

              <p>
                A Mercenary unit is friendly to the other units in its army but
                is not considered part of that army’s faction. When including
                Mercenary units in an army, use order tokens with a back that
                corresponds to the faction of the army. Players fielding an army
                that includes only Mercenary units use the Mercenary order
                tokens.

              <p class="example-text">
                For example, Black Sun Enforcers in a Galactic Empire army are
                friendly to other units in the army but are not part of the
                Galactic Empire faction. Black Sun Enforcers in a Galactic
                Empire army would use Galactic Empire order tokens.

              <h4>Movement</h4>
              <p>
                When a unit performs a move action, it performs a standard move
                or climb. Miniatures have one of two types of bases— notched or
                unnotched. What kind of base a miniature has determines how that
                unit performs moves. Creature troopers, emplacement troopers,
                and vehicles all have notched bases.
              </p>
              <div class="callout">
                <h5>Leaving the Battlefield</h5>
                <p>
                  Units may not voluntarily end a movement with any of its
                  miniature’s bases partially or fully outside the battlefield.
                  A miniature may leave the battlefield temporarily if it ends
                  its movement with its base fully inside the battlefield, such
                  as when a unit with a notched base moves along the movement
                  tool. If this is not possible, the miniature stops its
                  movement when it contacts the edge of the battlefield, then it
                  loses any remaining actions and may not perform any free
                  actions.
                </p>
              </div>
              <h5>Standard Move</h5>
              <p>
                To perform a standard move, take a movement tool of lower or
                equal speed of the moving unit and place it flat on the
                battlefield so that one end wholly touches the base of the
                unit’s unit leader. Then, the player may adjust the joint of the
                movement tool as they wish. After the movement tool has been
                adjusted, pick up the unit leader miniature and place it either
                wholly touching the other end of the movement tool, or anywhere
                centered along the path created by the movement tool, moving the
                movement tool out of the way and placing the miniature on the
                battlefield. A unit may choose to use a movement tool of a lower
                speed when performing a move unless otherwise specified.
              </p>
              <p>
                After placing the unit leader miniature, pick up any other
                miniatures in the unit and place them in cohesion. If for any
                reason a miniature cannot be placed in cohesion at the end of a
                move, place it as close as possible to the unit leader.
              </p>

                Marco declares a move action with his Battle Droid unit and
                chooses to perform a standard move with them. As the Battle
                Droids are speed-2, he may choose either the speed-1 or speed-2
                movement tool. Marco chooses the speed-2 movement tool and
                places it flat on the battlefield so that one end touches the
                unit leader's base. Then, he may adjust the movement tool at its
                joint as he wishes. After he is content with the placement and
                position of the movement tool, Marco picks up the Battle Droid’s
                unit leader and places it back down on the battlefield so that
                its base wholly touches the end of the movement tool. Then, he
                picks up the rest of the miniatures in the Battle Droid unit and
                places them so that they are all at a speed-1 move away from
                their unit leader.
              </p>
              <p>
                Units on notched bases follow all the above rules for movement,
                with the following exceptions:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  To perform a standard move with a notched base, a unit takes a
                  movement tool less than or equal to its speed characteristic
                  and places it flat on the battlefield so that one end is
                  wholly inside the front notch of the unit leader’s base.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Then, the player may adjust the movement tool at its joint as
                  they wish. After the movement tool has been adjusted, the
                  player decides to make either a full or partial move.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Unlike normal bases, notched bases cannot be placed anywhere
                  along the tool and instead move along the tool, as detailed
                  below.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To execute a partial move, pick up the unit leader miniature
                  and move it along the movement tool, taking care to keep the
                  movement tool lined up with the front and rear notches on the
                  base. The player may choose to stop this movement anywhere
                  along the path created by the movement tool, moving the
                  movement tool out of the way and placing the miniature on the
                  battlefield. The miniature must be placed in such a way so
                  that the line of the front and back notches on its base are
                  parallel to the section of the movement tool the miniature
                  reached at the farthest part of its move.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To execute a full move, pick up the unit leader miniature and
                  move it along the movement tool, taking care to keep the
                  movement tool lined up with the front and rear notches on the
                  base. The player places the miniature so that the other end of
                  the movement tool is inserted in the back notch of the
                  miniature’s base.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When a miniature performs a full or partial move, if the base
                  of the miniature is impeded by an object while moving along
                  the movement tool, it must stop its movement prematurely
                  unless it can legally move through, over, or on top of the
                  obstructing object. Move the movement tool out of the way and
                  place the miniature on the battlefield accordingly.
                </li>
                <li>
                  After placing the unit leader miniature, pick up any other
                  miniatures in the unit and place them in cohesion. Miniatures
                  with notched bases must be placed in the exact same
                  directional orientation as their unit leader’s base. If for
                  any reason a miniature cannot be placed in cohesion at the end
                  of a move, place it as close to the unit leader as possible.

                Simone wants to perform a standard move with her Swoop Bike
                Riders. She chooses to use the speed-3 movement tool since the
                Swoop Bike Riders are speed-3. She places the movement tool in
                the front notch of the Swoop Bike Riders unit leader's base.
                Next, she adjusts the movement tool as she wishes, then decides
                if she wants to perform a full or partial move. She decides to
                perform a full move and picks up the miniature and moves it

                that the front and rear notches on its base are parallel to the

                If terrain impedes a full or partial movement, the miniature
                must stop prematurely. Because the tower is stopping the Swoop
                Bike Riders movement, it ends its movement even though it has
                not traveled the full distance of the movement tool.
              </p>
              <h4>Moving with Notched Bases</h4>
              <p>
                Miniatures with notched bases have a number of additional
                movement options available to them:
              </p>
              <h5>Pivot</h5>
              <p>
                Some miniatures that have notched bases can pivot. If a unit can
                pivot, it is noted in the rules for its unit type.
              </p>
              <p>
                When a unit that can pivot performs a move action, it may choose
                to pivot instead of performing another movement. To pivot,
                rotate the unit leader’s base to 90° to the left or right,
                keeping the center of the base in the same place. If a unit
                contains multiple miniatures, each miniature in the unit must
                pivot so that the directional orientation of its base is the
                same as the unit leader’s.
              </p>
              <p>
                A miniature cannot overlap other miniatures’ bases while
                pivoting unless it can displace those miniatures.
              </p>
              <h5>Reverse</h5>
              <p>
                Some miniatures on notched bases can reverse. Only certain unit
                types may reverse.
              </p>
              <p>
                When a unit performs a move action, it may choose to reverse
                instead of making another movement. When performing a reverse,
                follow the normal rules for moving with a notched base with the
                following exceptions:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  When performing a partial reverse, instead of placing the
                  movement tool wholly in the front notch of the unit leader’s
                  base at the start of a move, place the movement tool wholly in
                  the rear notch.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When performing a full reverse, instead of placing the
                  movement tool in the front notch of the unit leader’s base,
                  place it in the rear notch. Then place the front notch of the
                  unit leader’s base on the other end of the movement tool.
                </li>
                <li>
                  While reversing, a unit reduces its speed by 1 to a minimum of
                  1.
                </li>
              </ul>

                <h5>Miniatures Physically Interfering with Movement</h5>
                <p>
                  While moving a miniature, treat the non-base portion of all
                  miniatures as if they do not exist. A miniature’s movement
                  cannot be impeded by the non-base parts of itself or another
                  miniature.

                  Some abilities provide standard moves, often of certain
                  speeds. A move provided by an ability is not a move action
                  unless specifically stated.

                <h5>Movement and Objective Tokens</h5>
                <p>
                  Miniatures can move through but cannot be placed overlapping
                  objective tokens.

              <h5>Moving Through Terrain</h5>
              <p>
                Battlefields in <em>Star Wars</em>: Legion are often covered
                with terrain that impedes troops' movements.
              </p>
              <p>
                When a unit performs a standard move, if it begins or ends a
                move with any of its miniatures in difficult terrain, or the
                movement tool overlaps a piece of difficult terrain, the unit
                reduces its speed by 1 to a minimum of 1. This may force the
                unit to use a movement tool of a lower speed than it originally
                intended.
              </p>
              <p>
                Miniatures can make standard moves onto or through obstacle
                terrain that is shorter than the height of the moving unit’s
                silhouette. When placing the movement tool, it may not overlap
                an obstacle terrain feature that is taller than the moving
                miniature’s silhouette. When a unit is overlapping an obstacle
                terrain feature, it may perform a standard move if the vertical
                distance changed is not greater than the height of the moving
                unit’s silhouette. If they wish to move onto, off of, or through
                obstacle terrain greater than the height of their silhouette,
                they must instead perform a climb. Miniatures on notched bases
                may not climb.
              </p>
              <p>
                Impassable terrain completely prevents movement. Miniatures
                cannot move or climb onto or through impassable terrain unless
                they have a special rule which allows them to do so.
              </p>
              <h5>Example: Performing a Standard Move Through Terrain</h5>

              <p class="example-text">
                Evan declares a move action with his Clone Trooper unit and
                chooses to perform a standard move with them. As the clones are
                speed-2, he may choose either the speed-1 or speed-2 movement
                tool. However, because the Clone Troopers are starting their
                move on difficult terrain, their speed is reduced by 1 to a
                minimum of 1, meaning they cannot use the speed-2 movement tool.
                Because their speed is reduced to a minimum of 1, moving over
                the barricade will not reduce their speed further.
              </p>
              <p class="example-text">
                If Obi-Wan Kenobi wishes to move into the same piece of
                difficult terrain as the Clone Troopers, he will reduce his
                speed by 1 to a minimum of 1 and must use the speed-1 movement
                tool because the movement template will overlap the difficult
                terrain.
              </p>
              <h5>Climbing</h5>
              <p>
                Sometimes units maneuver onto tall pieces of obstacle terrain.
                This is accomplished by performing a climb. Miniatures on
                notched bases may not climb.
              </p>
              <p>
                To perform a climb, a unit performs a move as normal, except
                that it must use the speed-1 tool. A miniature may move a
                vertical distance up to height 1 when making a climb and may
                place the movement tool overlapping obstacle terrain that is
                taller than the height of the moving unit’s silhouette.
              </p>

                Sarah wishes to move her Clone Trooper unit on top of the
                building. She measures the height of the building and determines
                that it is taller than the Clone Trooper's silhouette, meaning
                that the Clone Troopers cannot reach the top by performing a
                standard move. Instead, Sarah performs a climb with the Clone
                Troopers.
              </p>
              <p class="example-text">
                The Clone Troopers move as normal, except they must use the
                speed-1 movement tool when climbing, and they may move up to a
                vertical distance of height 1 when making a climb.

              <h4>Noncombatant</h4>
              <p>
                A miniature with the Noncombatant keyword cannot add any weapons
                to attack pools, and any wounds must be assigned to non-unit
                leader miniatures without the Noncombatant keyword, if able. If
                a miniature with the Noncombatant keyword already has one or
                more wound tokens, it must be assigned wounds before miniatures
                that do not have wound tokens. If the unit leader miniature in a
                unit with the Noncombatant keyword is defeated, a Noncombatant
                miniature cannot be replaced by a new unit leader miniature
                unless there are no other miniatures without the Noncombatant
                keyword.

              <h4>Notch</h4>
              <p>
                Some miniatures in <em>Star Wars</em>: Legion have notched
                bases. Units on notched bases follow all of the rules detailed
                in this section.
              </p>
              <h5>Deploying Oblong Bases</h5>
              <p>
                Some miniatures have oblong bases instead of round bases.
                Miniatures with oblong bases may extend beyond the boundary of a
                player’s deployment zone so long as its base is touching an edge
                of the battlefield within that deployment zone and at least half
                of the base is inside the boundary of the deployment zone.
              </p>
              <h5>Moving with Notched Bases</h5>
              <p>
                Miniatures with notched bases have a number of additional
                movement options available to them:
              </p>
              <h5>Pivot</h5>
              <p>
                Some miniatures that have notched bases can pivot. If a unit can
                pivot, it is noted in the rules for its unit type.
              </p>
              <p>
                When a unit that can pivot performs a move action, it may choose
                to pivot instead of performing another movement. To pivot,
                rotate the unit leader’s base to 90° to the left or right,
                keeping the center of the base in the same place. If a unit
                contains multiple miniatures, each miniature in the unit must
                pivot so that the directional orientation of its base is the
                same as the unit leader’s.
              </p>
              <p>
                A miniature cannot overlap other miniatures’ bases while
                pivoting unless it can displace those miniatures.
              </p>
              <h5>Reverse</h5>
              <p>
                Some miniatures on notched bases can reverse. Only certain unit
                types may reverse.
              </p>
              <p>
                When a unit performs a move action, it may choose to reverse
                instead of making another movement. When performing a reverse,
                follow the normal rules for moving with a notched base with the
                following exceptions:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  When performing a partial reverse, instead of placing the
                  movement tool wholly in the front notch of the unit leader’s
                  base at the start of a move, place the movement tool wholly in
                  the rear notch.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When performing a full reverse, instead of placing the
                  movement tool in the front notch of the unit leader’s base,
                  place it in the rear notch. Then place the front notch of the
                  unit leader’s base on the other end of the movement tool.
                </li>
                <li>
                  While reversing, a unit reduces its speed by 1 to a minimum of
                  1.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Displacement</h5>
              <p>
                Some miniatures with notched bases can force other miniatures to
                move out of their way, usually due to their large physical size.
                This is called displacement.
              </p>

              <h5>Attacking with Notched Bases</h5>
              <p>
                Miniatures with notched bases have four different arcs
                represented by lines sculpted on their bases: front, two sides,
                and rear. These arcs are referenced by certain rules, such as
                the Fixed and Weak Point keywords.

                  Used to mark the location of objectives on the battlefield. An
                  objective token has two sides: a red claimed and blank
                  unclaimed side.

                Units in Star Wars: Legion frequently capture objective tokens
                to score victory tokens and win the mission. Some objective
                tokens can be interacted with, usually through card actions
                listed on the Objective Battle Card.
              </p>
              <p>
                All objective tokens are placed with their unclaimed side faceup
                unless otherwise specified. When placing objective tokens in the
                battlefield during Setup, an objective token cannot be placed
                overlapping another objective token or only partially
                overlapping a piece of terrain. If an objective token would be
                placed partially overlapping terrain, players should adjust
                terrain placement in a mutually agreeable manner so that the
                token is no longer partially overlapping terrain. If an
                Objective Battle Card states that an objective is placed in base
                contact with a unit during Setup, that objective token is
                claimed by that unit.
              </p>
              <p>
                A unit may not begin the first round of the game in base contact
                with an unclaimed objective token.

                <li>
                  During the Command Phase, when a player issues orders to a
                  unit by playing a command card, that player places an order
                  token displaying that unit’s rank on the battlefield next to
                  that unit; the player places the order token so its rank side
                  is faceup.
                </li>
                <li>
                  After issuing orders to units during the Command Phase, a
                  player places any order tokens not on the battlefield into
                  that player’s order pool.
                </li>
                <li>
                  During the Activation Phase, a player either activates a
                  friendly unit with a faceup order token or takes a random
                  order token from their order pool and activates a friendly
                  unit with a matching rank that does not have an order token.
                </li>
                <li>
                  After a player activates their unit, they place that unit’s
                  order token near that unit on the battlefield so its rank side
                  is facedown and its faction side is faceup. This facedown
                  order token indicates that the unit has activated during this
                  game round.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When a unit is defeated, its order token is removed from the
                  game, either when an order token is drawn from the pool that
                  does not match the rank of any unactivated unit on the
                  battlefield, or in the End Phase.

                is an overrun weapon and can only be used during overrun
                attacks. Overrun attacks are not ranged or melee attacks. A unit
                may make X overrun attacks during its activation. A unit with an
                overrun weapon can perform an overrun attack after it performs a
                standard move in which one of its miniatures’ bases overlapped
                an enemy miniature’s base. After completing the move and
                resolving any displacement, the unit with the overrun weapon
                performs an attack against the unit it moved through, ignoring
                range when making this attack. It can only form one attack pool
                when making this attack, and only weapons with the Overrun X
                keyword can be in this attack pool. The overrun weapon is only
                added to the attack pool once, even if there are multiple
                miniatures in the unit.
              </p>
              <p>
                If a unit can perform multiple overrun attacks during its
                activation, it must perform a separate move through an enemy
                unit for each overrun attack.

                If a unit has a number of suppression tokens that is equal to or

                <p>
                  When a unit checks to see if it is panicked, instead of using

                  unit at range 1–3. For example, a unit with 3 suppression
                  tokens and courage value 1 would not be panicked if it chooses
                  to use the courage value of a friendly

                If a unit begins its Perform Actions step while panicked, it
                cannot perform any actions or free actions and drops any claimed
                objective tokens it may have. Then, if a unit did not perform
                any actions or free actions due to panic, at the end of the
                unit’s activation, it removes suppression tokens equal to its
                courage value.

              <h4>Pivot</h4>
              <p>
                Some miniatures that have notched bases can pivot. If a unit can
                pivot, it is noted in the rules for its unit type.
              </p>
              <p>
                When a unit that can pivot performs a move action, it may choose
                to pivot instead of performing another movement. To pivot,
                rotate the unit leader’s base to 90° to the left or right,
                keeping the center of the base in the same place. If a unit
                contains multiple miniatures, each miniature in the unit must
                pivot so that the directional orientation of its base is the
                same as the unit leader’s.
              </p>
              <p>
                A miniature cannot overlap other miniatures’ bases while
                pivoting unless it can displace those miniatures.

                suppressed, it performs one fewer action during its Perform
                Actions step.
              </p>
              <p>
                If a unit begins its Perform Actions step while panicked, it
                cannot perform any actions or free actions and drops any claimed
                objective tokens it may have. Then, if a unit did not perform
                any actions or free actions due to panic, at the end of the
                unit’s activation, it removes suppression tokens equal to its
                courage value.
              </p>
              <h5>EXAMPLE: SUPPRESSED AND PANICKED</h5>
              <p class="example-text">
                On Ryan’s turn, he chooses to activate a Clone Trooper unit with
                two suppression tokens. After resolving any effects at the start
                of the Clone Trooper unit’s activation, he performs the unit’s
                Rally step and rolls two white defense dice, one for each
                suppression token. Unfortunately, he rolls two blanks and does
                not remove any suppression tokens from the unit. Because the
                Clone Troopers have a courage value of 1 and have a number of
                suppression tokens equal to or greater than their courage value,
                they are still suppressed and must perform one fewer action
                during the Perform Actions step of their activation.
              </p>
              <p class="example-text">
                Additionally, because the Clone Troopers have suppression equal
                to or greater than double their courage value, they are still
                panicked as well as suppressed. Therefore, they drop any claimed
                objective tokens, perform no actions or free actions, and at the
                end of their activation, they remove suppression tokens equal to
                their courage value.

                place one wound token on the card that has the Repair X:

                Additionally, each action is considered unique, and a unit that

                card effects, allow a player to restore miniatures to friendly
                units. To restore a miniature to a unit, that unit must have had
                one or more miniatures defeated that round. Choose a miniature
                that was defeated during the current round and place that
                miniature on the battlefield in cohesion with its unit leader.
                Then, give that miniature a number of wound tokens equal to one
                less than the wound threshold indicated on its Unit Card.

                When a unit performs a move action, it may choose to reverse
                instead of making another movement. When performing a reverse,
                follow the normal rules for moving with a notched base with the
                following exceptions:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  When performing a partial reverse, instead of placing the
                  movement tool wholly in the front notch of the unit leader’s
                  base at the start of a move, place the movement tool wholly in
                  the rear notch.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When performing a full reverse, instead of placing the
                  movement tool in the front notch of the unit leader’s base,
                  place it in the rear notch. Then place the front notch of the
                  unit leader’s base on the other end of the movement tool.
                </li>
                <li>
                  While reversing, a unit reduces its speed by 1 to a minimum of
                  1.

                Trooper units whose unit leader is at range 1 of a smoke token
                improve the numerical value of their cover by 1 during the
                Determine Cover step. While a trooper unit is attacking, if the
                attacking unit leader is at range 1 of a smoke token, the

                A compulsory move is a free move action. To perform a compulsory
                move, the unit performs a full move at its maximum speed. If it
                cannot do so, or if a full move would cause any part of the unit
                leader’s base to be outside the battlefield, it can perform a
                partial move instead, ending its movement as far along the
                movement template as possible.

                When a miniature adds a weapon that has the Spray keyword to the

                For example, if an AT-RT with a flamethrower attacks a unit of
                three Death Troopers, since the flamethrower has the Spray
                keyword and an attack value of two black die, the flamethrower

              <h4>Spur (Unit Keyword)</h4>
              <p>
                When a unit with the Spur keyword performs a move, its
                controlling player may assign it one suppression token to
                increase its maximum speed by 1 for that move, to a maximum of
                3. When a unit performs a move, apply any effects that increase
                the unit’s maximum speed before applying any effects that reduce
                that unit’s maximum speed.
              </p>
              <p class="example-text">
                For example, a unit that normally has a maximum speed of 1, but
                has one immobilize token, can use the Spur keyword to perform a
                move with a total maximum speed of 1. However, a unit that
                normally has a maximum speed of 1, but has two immobilize
                tokens, cannot use the Spur keyword to perform a move because
                its maximum speed would still be 0.

              <p>
                To perform a standard move, take a movement tool of lower or
                equal speed of the moving unit and place it flat on the
                battlefield so that one end wholly touches the base of the
                unit’s unit leader. Then, the player may adjust the joint of the
                movement tool as they wish. After the movement tool has been
                adjusted, pick up the unit leader miniature and place it either
                wholly touching the other end of the movement tool, or anywhere
                centered along the path created by the movement tool, moving the
                movement tool out of the way and placing the miniature on the
                battlefield. A unit may choose to use a movement tool of a lower
                speed when performing a move unless otherwise specified.
              </p>
              <p>
                After placing the unit leader miniature, pick up any other
                miniatures in the unit and place them in cohesion. If for any
                reason a miniature cannot be placed in cohesion at the end of a
                move, place it as close as possible to the unit leader.

                Marco declares a move action with his Battle Droid unit and
                chooses to perform a standard move with them. As the Battle
                Droids are speed-2, he may choose either the speed-1 or speed-2
                movement tool. Marco chooses the speed-2 movement tool and
                places it flat on the battlefield so that one end touches the
                unit leader's base. Then, he may adjust the movement tool at its
                joint as he wishes. After he is content with the placement and
                position of the movement tool, Marco picks up the Battle Droid’s
                unit leader and places it back down on the battlefield so that
                its base wholly touches the end of the movement tool. Then, he
                picks up the rest of the miniatures in the Battle Droid unit and
                places them so that they are all at a speed-1 move away from
                their unit leader.

                A trooper or ground vehicle unit can perform the standby action
                to gain a standby token. Place it on the battlefield near the
                unit’s unit leader. A unit cannot perform an attack action and a
                standby action in the same activation. A unit may only have one
                standby token at a time.

              <p>
                During the Activation Phase, after an enemy unit at range 1–2
                and in LOS of any miniature in a friendly trooper or ground
                vehicle unit with a standby token performs an attack, move, or
                action, if it is not the friendly unit’s activation, it may
                spend a standby token to perform a free attack action or a free

                If a unit performs a move, an attack, an action, or gains a

              <p>
                A unit may only ever spend one standby token per triggering
                effect. A standby token is spent before any effects that trigger
                after an attack, attack action, move, or move action. A unit
                cannot spend a standby token until all of an attacking unit’s
                attack pools have been resolved.

              <p>
                If the unit with the Hover: Ground/Air X keyword has a base with
                side notches, the unit may perform a strafe move as part of a
                movement action instead of moving normally. A unit reduces its
                maximum speed by 1 to a minimum of 1 while performing a strafe.
                As with other movements with notched bases, a strafe can be a
                full strafe or a partial strafe, and can be interrupted if an
                object prevents the strafing miniature from fully progressing
                across the movement tool.
              </p>
              <p>
                To perform a full strafe, place the end of a movement tool into
                one of the side notches on the unit’s base. Keeping the movement
                tool in place on the battlefield, move the miniature along the
                movement tool until the opposite side notch is wholly in the
                opposite end of the movement tool. While performing a strafe, a
                miniature’s base must not overlap terrain or units that it
                cannot move through.

                Suppression represents the morale and combat effectiveness of a
                unit—the more suppression it has, the less effective it is on
                the battlefield. Suppression is tracked during the game with
                suppression tokens. Vehicles do not suffer suppression.
              </p>
              <p>
                Trooper units have a courage value on their Unit Card. When a
                unit has a number of suppression tokens equal to or greater than
                its courage value, it is suppressed. If a unit has a number of
                suppression tokens that is equal to or greater than double its
                courage value, it is panicked. A suppressed unit performs one
                less action each activation, while a panicked unit cannot
                perform actions, including free actions.
              </p>
              <h5>Rallying</h5>
              <p>
                Each time a unit activates, it has a chance to rally and remove
                suppression tokens. To rally a unit, its controlling player
                rolls one white defense die for each suppression token the unit
                has. Then its controlling player removes one suppression token
                for each
                <img src="/img/legion-block.png" class="game-icon" /> or
                <img src="/img/legion-defense-surge.png" class="game-icon" />
                result rolled.
              </p>
              <p>
                After rallying, if a unit begins its Perform Actions step while
                suppressed, it performs one fewer action during its Perform
                Actions step.
              </p>
              <p>
                If a unit begins its Perform Actions step while panicked, it
                cannot perform any actions or free actions and drops any claimed
                objective tokens it may have. Then, if a unit did not perform
                any actions or free actions due to panic, at the end of the
                unit’s activation, it removes suppression tokens equal to its
                courage value.
              </p>

                two suppression tokens. After resolving any effects at the start

                Clone Troopers have a courage value of 1 and have a number of
                suppression tokens equal to or greater than their courage value,
                they are still suppressed and must perform one fewer action
                during the Perform Actions step of their activation.
              </p>
              <p class="example-text">
                Additionally, because the Clone Troopers have suppression equal
                to or greater than double their courage value, they are still
                panicked as well as suppressed. Therefore, they drop any claimed
                objective tokens, perform no actions or free actions, and at the
                end of their activation, they remove suppression tokens equal to
                their courage value.

                Surges are icons that appear on attack and defense dice. A surge
                has no inherent effect, but some units can change surges into
                other icons after making attack or defense rolls.

                  conversion chart that indicates whether that unit can convert
                  surge icons to other icons. If either of a unit’s surge
                  conversion charts are blank, that unit cannot convert the

              <h4>Terrain (Unit Keyword)</h4>
              <p>
                The scenery and features that make up the battlefield are
                terrain. Terrain serves more of a purpose than simply being
                aesthetically pleasing—the terrain over which armies fight can
                have as dramatic an impact on the course of battle as the
                abilities of the armies themselves. Players should always
                discuss terrain before the game starts. There are three types of
                terrain: scatter terrain, area terrain, and obstacle terrain.
              </p>
              <h5>Scatter Terrain</h5>
              <p>
                Scatter terrain represents small terrain features such as
                crates, planters, or lamp posts.
              </p>
              <div class="callout">
                <p>
                  Barricades are a specific type of scatter terrain found in
                  some Star Wars: Legion Core Sets and in their own expansion
                  pack. Barricades are difficult terrain for trooper units and
                  provide non-creature trooper units with heavy cover.
                </p>
                <img
                  class="example-photo"
                  src="/img/barricades.jpg"
                  alt="barricades"
                />
                <p>
                  Barricades cannot be placed overlapping objective or condition
                  tokens and cannot have objective or condition tokens placed on
                  them. A trooper miniature can never partially overlap a
                  barricade at any time.
                </p>
              </div>
              <h5>Area Terrain</h5>
              <p>
                Some terrain features consist of an area of terrain containing
                multiple terrain elements inside a boundary or footprint, like a
                forest, craters, ruined buildings, or piles of rubble. The
                individual elements and their locations inside the area terrain
                are not relevant, only the boundary.
              </p>
              <p>
                When determining the size of area terrain, imagine a silhouette
                beginning at the bottom of the area terrain and extending
                upwards to the tallest point of the terrain. The volume of this
                silhouette is all part of the area terrain. It is up to the
                players to determine the height, the boundaries, special rules,
                and the type of cover that area terrain provides.
              </p>

                alt="broken AT-ST area terrain example"
                loading="lazy"
              />
              <h5>Obstacle Terrain</h5>
              <p>
                Obstacle terrain represents large or tall terrain features such
                as buildings, cliffs, or high walls. When a trooper miniature
                wants to move through or onto an obstacle terrain feature, it
                may have to perform a climb based on the obstacle terrain’s
                height.
              </p>
              <h5>Terrain Restricting Movement</h5>
              <p>
                In addition to being scatter, area, or obstacle terrain, a
                terrain feature is also open, difficult, or impassable.
              </p>
              <p>
                Open terrain represents parts of the battlefield that are
                relatively easy to traverse and free from obstacles or
                obstructions. Open fields, lamp posts, planters, tall grass, or
                sandy desert are all open terrain. Open terrain does not
                restrict movement.
              </p>
              <p>
                Difficult terrain restricts but does not completely prevent
                movement. Craters, barricades, ruins, woods, piles of rubble,
                and swamps are all examples of difficult terrain. Difficult
                terrain reduces the maximum speed of a unit moving through or
                into it by 1 to a minimum of 1.
              </p>
              <p>
                Impassable terrain completely prevents movement. Miniatures
                cannot move through or end a movement on impassable terrain
                unless they have a special rule which allows them to do so.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some larger and more complex pieces of terrain are made up of
                various parts that each restrict movement differently. For
                example, the walls of a piece of obstacle terrain may be
                impassable, but a miniature may be able to move through a door
                or window that is open terrain. Players should discuss the parts
                of terrain and agree on how they are to be played before the
                game begins.
              </p>

              <p class="example-text">
                The Clone Trooper unit is preparing to move. The battlefield is
                open terrain and does not restrict the Clone Trooper unit’s
                movement. The barricades are difficult terrain and will slow
                down the Clone Troopers should they choose to move over them.
                The building is impassable terrain, and the Clone Troopers may
                not move through it unless they have a special rule that allows
                them to do so.
              </p>
              <div class="callout">
                <h5>Fitting on Terrain</h5>
                <p>
                  When a trooper miniature’s base is overlapping a piece of
                  obstacle terrain, it must be completely overlapping that
                  terrain. Trooper miniatures cannot end a movement or be placed
                  in a way that would cause their base to only partially overlap
                  a piece of obstacle terrain and may not have any part of part
                  of its base hanging off the terrain. Trooper miniatures cannot
                  be deployed in a way where any part of their base is only
                  partially overlapping a piece of obstacle terrain.
                </p>
              </div>
              <h5>Example: Fitting on Terrain</h5>
              <img
                src="img/fitting-on-terrain.jpg"

                class="example-photo"
                loading="lazy"
              />
              <p class="example-text">
                When placing miniatures on obstacle terrain, a miniature's base
                must completely overlap the terrain. Because the two Clone
                Troopers are hanging off the balcony and only partially
                overlapping the piece of obstacle terrain, they cannot be placed
                there and must be placed in such a way that their bases
                completely overlap the obstacle terrain like the other two Clone
                Troopers.
              </p>
              <h5>Terrain Providing Cover</h5>
              <p>
                The main purpose of terrain is to block line of sight between
                miniatures and provide them with cover. Terrain provides either
                light, heavy, or no cover. What kind of cover, if any, a piece
                of terrain provides is ultimately for players to decide. Before
                the game begins, players should agree on what kind of cover each
                piece of terrain on the battlefield provides.
              </p>
              <h5>Terrain Height</h5>
              <p>
                Each piece of terrain has a height characteristic. To measure
                this, take the range tool and put one end on the battlefield,
                orienting the range tool vertically. Then add segments until the
                end of the range tool is taller than the piece of terrain. The
                segment of the range tool that the top of the terrain is inside
                is equal to that object’s height.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some terrain might have various pieces at multiple heights. When
                determining the height of the terrain for the purposes of
                performing a movement or a climb, measure the height of the part
                of the terrain the miniatures are moving or climbing to,
                subtracting the height of any terrain the miniatures may be on.
              </p>
              <h5>Example: Measuring Height</h5>
              <img
                src="img/terrain-height.jpg"

              <p class="example-text">
                Sarah wants to measure the height of this building to determine
                how it will impede the movement of her Clone Troopers. To do so,
                she takes the range tool and places one end on the battlefield,
                holding the range tool upright. Because the roof of the building
                is entirely inside the first segment of the range tool, the
                building is considered height 1.
              </p>
              <p class="example-text">
                Later in the game, Sarah measures the height of another
                building. Because this building has multiple levels, it consists
                of different heights. One roof is completely inside the first
                segment of the range tool, so that part of the building is
                height 1. However, the second roof of the building is inside the
                second segment of the range tool, so that part of the building
                is height 2.

                <h4>The Golden Rule of Terrain</h4>
                <p>
                  Ultimately, the type of terrain and the rules used are up to
                  the players and should be discussed before the game begins.

              <h4>Timing</h4>
              <p>
                Some rules refer to the active player; the active player is the
                player whose turn it is.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sometimes effects will occur at the same time. The player with
                priority always resolves their effects first. If neither player
                has priority, the blue player resolves their effects first. If a
                player has multiple effects that occur at the same time, they
                choose the order in which to resolve effects.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sometimes an effect happens after something is resolved, which
                means that the effect happens after that thing has been totally
                completed.

                The Transport X keyword allows a vehicle to transport up to X

                move to be transported by a vehicle with the Transport X

                During Setup, if a player has deployed a vehicle with the
                Transport X keyword, they may choose, as one of their
                deployments, to deploy an eligible unit such that it is being
                transported by that vehicle, even if that vehicle is outside
                their deployment zone.

                Units can be transported by vehicles with the Transport X and
                Light Transport X keyword. A unit that has embarked onto a
                vehicle is being transported by that vehicle until it disembarks
                from that vehicle. There are two different types of vehicles a
                unit can be transported in, those with the Transport X: Closed
                keyword and those with the Transport X: Open keyword.

              <p>
                Units being transported in a vehicle with the Transport X:
                Closed keyword follow these rules:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  While a unit is being transported, it cannot spend tokens.
                </li>
                <li>
                  While a unit is being transported, it can gain tokens from
                  card effects as normal.
                </li>
                <li>
                  While a unit is being transported, it removes tokens at the
                  end of the round as normal.
                </li>
                <li>
                  While a unit is being transported, it cannot perform any
                  actions except for the move action (including free actions)
                  and it can only use this action to disembark.
                </li>
                <li>
                  While a unit is being transported, it cannot perform attacks
                  or be chosen to be the defender of an attack.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When measuring range from a transported unit, measure from the
                  base of the vehicle that is transporting that unit. When
                  measuring range to a transported unit, measure to the base of
                  the vehicle that is transporting that unit.
                </li>
                <li>
                  While a unit is being transported, it can suffer wounds as
                  normal.

                  performs its Rally step as normal.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Units can be issued orders while being transported.

                  When a vehicle that is transporting a unit is defeated, before
                  removing that vehicle from the battlefield, place the unit
                  leader of a transported unit in base contact with the vehicle.
                  Then, remove the vehicle and place any other miniatures in
                  cohesion. The unit that was being transported gains a
                  suppression token and suffers one wound. Then, flip any order
                  tokens the unit has facedown or assign it a facedown order
                  token if it does not have any.

                  If a vehicle is in base contact with a piece of terrain or
                  another miniature, a unit being transported by that vehicle is
                  not considered to be in base contact with that piece of
                  terrain or that other miniature.

                Units being transported in a vehicle with the Transport X: Open

                  While a unit is being transported, it can spend any token.
                </li>
                <li>
                  While a unit is being transported, its weapons ignore the
                  restrictions of any Fixed keywords when performing attacks.
                </li>
                <li>
                  While a unit is being transported, it can perform any action

                    <li>
                      During the unit’s activation, if the vehicle that is
                      transporting that unit has performed more than one
                      standard move or reverse during the current round, the
                      unit may only perform one action and cannot perform
                      additional actions or any free actions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If the unit performs an attack action, measure range from
                      the base of the vehicle that is transporting that unit and
                      determine LOS as though the vehicle is performing the
                      attack.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                <li>If the unit performs a move action, it must disembark.</li>
                <li>
                  A unit that is being transported can be the target of an
                  attack. Measure range and determine LOS from the attacking
                  unit leader to the vehicle that is transporting the unit, as
                  though the vehicle is defending against the attack.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When determining LOS to or from a transported unit, determine
                  LOS from the vehicle that is transporting that unit.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A unit that is being transported has heavy cover. This cover
                  can be reduced as normal.
                </li>
                <li>
                  After a unit that is being transported defends against a
                  ranged attack, it receives a suppression token as normal.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If a vehicle transporting a unit is in base contact with an
                  enemy unit, the unit that is being transported and the enemy
                  unit cannot perform ranged attacks against each other.
                  However, these units can perform melee attacks against each
                  other but are not engaged and are not considered to be in base
                  contact with each other, except for the purposes of a melee
                  attack.

                Light Transport X keyword. A unit that has embarked onto a
                vehicle is being transported by that vehicle until it disembarks
                from that vehicle. There are two different types of vehicles a
                unit can be transported in, those with the Transport X: Closed
                keyword and those with the Transport X: Open keyword.

              <h4>Treat X: Capacity Y (Upgrade Keyword</h4>
              <p>
                When a unit uses the Treat X: Capacity Y card action, choose a
                friendly non-droid trooper unit at range 1 and LOS and place one
                wound token on the card that has the Treat X: Capacity Y
                keyword. Remove a total of up to X wound and/or poison tokens
                from the chosen unit or restore up to X miniatures to that unit.
                This ability cannot be used if the card that has the Treat X:
                Capacity Y keyword has a number of wound tokens on it equal to
                or exceeding Y.
              </p>
              <p>
                Wound tokens on cards are not considered to be on units and do
                not count toward a unit’s wound threshold, nor can they be
                removed by abilities that remove wound tokens from units.
              </p>
              <p>
                If a unit has multiple Treat X: Capacity Y abilities, treat each
                keyword as a separate ability.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, each action is considered to be unique, and a unit
                that has access to more than one can use each ability once
                during its activation. This applies even if the unit has access
                to two identical abilities from different sources.
              </p>
              <h5>Restore</h5>
              <p>
                Some abilities, such as the Treat and Repair keywords or certain
                card effects, allow a player to restore miniatures to friendly
                units. To restore a miniature to a unit, that unit must have had
                one or more miniatures defeated that round. Choose a miniature
                that was defeated during the current round and place that
                miniature on the battlefield in cohesion with its unit leader.
                Then, give that miniature a number of wound tokens equal to one
                less than the wound threshold indicated on its Unit Card.

              <h4>Troopers</h4>
              <p>
                Trooper is the most common unit type in Star Wars: Legion.
                Trooper units may have the following subtypes, each with their
                own additional rules:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Clone Trooper</li>
                <li>Creature Trooper</li>
                <li>Droid Trooper</li>
                <li>Emplacement Trooper</li>
                <li>Wookiee Trooper</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Rules that affect a trooper unit affect all its subtypes.
                Subtypes must follow all the rules of normal troopers unless
                otherwise stated.

                Some units and upgrades represent specific characters, weapons,
                or equipment. Unique or limited cards are identified by a number
                of bullets (•) in front of their name. The number of bullets
                indicates the maximum number of cards a player can field that
                share the same name. This restriction also applies across card
                types. For example, if a name has two bullets in front of it,
                the player could field two units with that name, two upgrades
                with that name, one Unit Card and one upgrade with that name,
                etc.

              <h4>Weapons</h4>
              <p>
                Each unit is equipped with weapons that miniatures may
                contribute to attack pools. Every weapon has a range and dice it
                contributes to an attack pool when used by a miniature during an
                attack. Some weapons have keywords associated with them, called
                weapon keywords. Weapons on Upgrade or Command Cards sometimes
                have their own surge charts.
              </p>
              <p>
                A weapon with a melee range is a melee weapon, and a weapon with
                a blue range icon is a ranged weapon. A weapon with both a melee
                icon and one or more blue ranged icons can be used as a melee
                weapon or a ranged weapon, chosen when the weapon is added to an
                attack pool—treat the weapon as that type for the duration of
                the attack sequence.
              </p>
              <p>
                An attack pool that contains melee weapons is a melee attack,
                while an attack pool that contains ranged weapons is a ranged
                attack.

              <p>
                At the start of its activation, a unit with the Wheel Mode
                keyword can increase its maximum speed to 3 until the end of
                that activation. If it does, until the end of the round, it
                gains the Cover 2 keyword and cannot attack or flip active
                shield tokens.
              </p>
              <p>
                To indicate that a unit of Droidekas is using the Wheel Mode
                keyword, a player may replace their standing Droideka miniatures
                with ball-form Droideka miniatures, or simply mark the unit with
                a Wheel Mode token.
              </p>
              <p>
                Players should use the ball-form Droideka miniatures only when
                the unit uses the Wheel Mode keyword and only for the duration
                of that round. At the end of the round, any ballform Droideka
                miniatures should be replaced with standing Droideka miniatures.

              <h4>Winning the Game</h4>
              <p>
                A player wins the game immediately by either defeating all their
                opponent’s units or by earning the most victory tokens at the
                end of the game. The game ends after the final End Phase, and
                victory tokens are scored as detailed by the Victory conditions
                on the Objective Card being used for that game.
              </p>
              <p>
                Panicked units and objective tokens they have claimed cannot be
                used to satisfy Victory conditions on an Objective Card.
              </p>
              <p>
                If an Objective Card instructs players to gain victory tokens at
                the end of a round, they do so after advancing the round counter
                and before the next round begins.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the players have an equal number of victory tokens at the end
                of the game, the player who defeated more points worth of their
                opponent’s army is the winner. When calculating how many points
                a player has defeated, only count units that were completely
                defeated, including any upgrades equipped to the unit. If
                players defeated the same number of points, the player whose
                army consisted of more points at the start of the game is the
                winner. If there is still a tie, the game is a draw.

                An engaged unit may leave melee during its activation by
                withdrawing. To withdraw, a unit must spend all its available
                actions and can perform no other actions that activation. Then
                it performs a speed-1 move action, ignoring any units it is in
                melee with. A unit with a maximum speed of 0 cannot withdraw. A
                unit cannot end a withdraw move action in melee.

              <h4>Within (Range)</h4>
              <p>
                Some abilities require two objects to be at, within, or beyond a
                certain distance from each other.
              </p>
              <p>
                An object is within a range of another object if it is entirely
                inside that range as measured by the range tool. For a unit to
                be within a range, all miniatures in the unit must be within the
                given range. A unit that is within a certain range is also at
                that range.

              <p>
                When a player’s unit suffers wounds, that player chooses a
                miniature from that unit and assigns wound tokens to it until
                either all wounds have been suffered or the miniature is
                defeated.
              </p>
              <p>
                A miniature is defeated when it has a number of wound tokens
                assigned to it equal to its wound threshold. If there are
                unassigned wounds remaining after a miniature has been defeated,
                the player chooses another miniature from the same unit and
                repeats the process until either all wounds have been assigned
                or all miniatures in the unit have been defeated. When a unit
                suffers wounds from an attack, if the attacker has LOS to only
                some of the miniatures in the defending unit, the defending unit
                cannot suffer wounds greater than the total wound threshold of
                miniatures that are in LOS.
              </p>
              <p>
                A unit leader cannot be assigned wounds unless it is the only
                miniature in the unit.
              </p>
              <p>
                A miniature or unit with at least one wound token is wounded.
                When assigning wound tokens, the wounded miniature with the most
                wound tokens must be chosen before any others when assigning
                wounds and must be assigned wounds until it is defeated. If more
                than one miniature has the same number of wound tokens assigned,
                choose one of those miniatures to assign wounds to.
              </p>
              <p>
                When a miniature is defeated, remove it from the battlefield. If
                a unit leader is defeated and there are still undefeated
                miniatures in the unit, the unit’s controlling player must
                immediately choose another miniature in that unit to become the
                unit leader, replacing that miniature with the unit leader
                miniature.
              </p>
              <p>
                When all of the miniatures in a unit are defeated, the unit is
                defeated. Remove all order tokens for that unit from the
                battlefield.

                <h5>Effects that Deal or Assign Wounds</h5>
                <p>
                  Some effects deal or assign wounds without going through the
                  attack sequence. These effects are not attacks, so no defense
                  dice are rolled, nor are any suppression tokens assigned. The
                  player that controls the unit suffering wounds assigns the
                  wounds as normal.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some effects explicitly state that a certain miniature in a
                  unit suffers wounds. In this case, the player who controls the
                  effect may assign any wounds suffered in this way, ignoring
                  the normal rules for assigning wounds.
                </p>
              </div>
              <h5>Example: Assigning Wounds and Defeating Miniatures</h5>
              <p class="example-text">
                After comparing results, Dallas’ unit of five Clone Troopers has
                suffered three wounds from an attack. He then assigns one of the
                wounds to a miniature in the unit. Since all the miniatures in
                the Clone Trooper unit have a wound threshold of 1, the
                miniature that Dallas assigned a wound to is defeated. Since
                there are two unassigned wounds remaining, Dallas chooses
                another miniature from the same unit and repeats the process
                until either all wounds have been suffered or all miniatures in
                the unit have been defeated. Since each Clone Trooper only has a
                wound threshold of 1 and the unit suffered three wounds, this
                means that three Clone Troopers are defeated, leaving two Clone
                Troopers remaining.
              </p>
              <p class="example-text">
                After comparing results, Chris’ unit of three unwounded Wookiees
                has suffered four wounds. He then assigns one of the wounds to a
                miniature in the unit. Because Wookiees have a wound threshold
                of 3, the Wookiee is not defeated when it is assigned the wound,
                and Chris has three more wounds left to assign. However, because
                the Wookiee has at least one wound token assigned to it, it is
                wounded, and Chris MUST choose to assign it any additional wound
                tokens since it has more wound tokens assigned to it than any
                other miniature in the unit. Chris is forced to assign the next
                two wounds to the Wookiee until it reaches its wound threshold
                of 3 and is defeated, leaving one wound left to be assigned.
                Chris must choose a non-unit leader Wookiee to assign the wound
                to. In the future, because the wounded Wookiee has more wound
                tokens than the other, Chris must assign wounds to it first, and
                must continue to do so until it is defeated.
